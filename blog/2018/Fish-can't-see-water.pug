            Everyone has a dogma to prefer stories with short-term emotional effects. You live and continue to contemplate the picture of how the essence of life, happines and human desires should be arranged. Society shows them to you and ofcourse you perfectly understand that it's simply does not work. The instance of the previous generation proves that generally people are unhappy. You see it simply by looking at the faces of people on the public transport that they all are unhappy, they live somehow not right and themselves understand this obsession. No one ever stops to even think, think about anything. Ask yourself a simple question of what and why am I even doing here. Everyone is running. They all have little time, because there's a lot of information that you are tended and actually want to consume, generating the gestaltzerfall effect, not because it's needed, but simply for fun. This effect is related to the concepts of "semantic satiation" and "the flow of meaning" arising from the excess of information. Gestaltzerfall (the shape decomposition) is described as a phenomenon in the study of Japanese language, in which hieroglyphs cease to be perceived in principle, collapsing the semantic field to a point, because of information overload and complexity of ambivalent information.

            Fatigue is a consequence of the race for a different rhythm, it's not all about speed or intensity, it's all about trying to catch someone elses. Consciousness doesn't get tired of itself, it gets tired of imitation, from a game that doesn't come from itself. Tired consciousness doesn't break, but simply falls asleep. Consciousness reveals itself, is fileld with horror, turns out somewhere, where language is possible, manifests itself through speech, seeping through itself.

            Everyone's turned into owls that wander the distant night. Flaccid, pale with red eyes, amicably whinning about their chronic lack of sleep, absorbed by information gluttony. A lot of noise, a very little sense. Nothing of significance, nothing of value. Fake quotes, distorted facts, silly and pointless jokes, playing on emotions and nothing more. One endless sentient perfomance. Everyone screams on each other, there's no way to make out the words. who's right and who's'nt is impossible to differentiate and any attempt to convey the truth is doomed to failure. It's necessary either also yell tearing the throat apart or -- being silent without any hope of being heard by anyone. Cyber-Gothics brings a hyper-heated criticism to ultramodern "vision tool" -- a telecommercial retina, fed by laser radiation from a collapsed future multimedia deposit -- filling the brain with reptetic psychopathic experiments during the forced deformation of the nervous system: crazy AI, replicants, cyberviruses, nano-horrors are nothing but an overload of the apocalyptic market. Why waiting for it completion? Tomorrow is already cremated in the underworld.

            As once Mikhailov pointed -- Foucault, analyzing universal grammars, notes the conditions of autistic children who speaks their own language, while perfectly understanding what they're told by others. But instead of accepting the language of the surrounding, they offer their own. Then the breakdown comes -- the world doesn't accept this immanent grammatic and breaks the will so they have to accept the language of the outside, merge it with their thinking. They lost the war for language. The next defeat comes in the war for the text. Multiple realities, written in textbooks are uninteresting from the outside, the world suggests writing a different text, explains how to do everything. Don't produce monotonous drawings, but follow the accepted canons. Parents, teachers, society just nod, sending you to where you can survive.

            Not a very long ago, in small vilalges, called then cities, people lived surrounded by silence. Time moved calmly and smoothly, it wasn't swept by an obscene voice, deforming an already not very acceptable finale of the history of mankind. Every story heard from a stranger is an occasion for reflection and awakening imagination, the reason and prerequisite. The very silence allowed to open to the real wonders of surrounding world and catch the rat at sunrise and sunset, in the stars, the 8-th firmanent layer. The world could become flesh. An angel could enter the house of a young virgin with the words of her rejoicing, recalling that the God is always with us. What would be the news about the arrival of the savior nowadays? The end of the world will be livestreamed. Angels even now speak with people at least as often as it was before, but no one hears or sees them because of a constant rumble and flickering flare, in which voices and silhouettes easily differ from the shadows of other entities. [Johannes Trithemius in his "Sacred Cryptography" also related the topic of cryptography and the theme of angels, this was pointed out by Maria de Rosario in her text "APOCALYPSE - BEEN IN EFFECT?"]. The very ones who do everything so that no one has the opportunity to and the desire to stop, listen, look around and think. At times and among their speech, the messengers of heaven ignored for a long time can also be heard. They're communicating with us in the language of suffering.
