        p We are living in a world that must be considered as one unified system that has memory, motivation, the ability to model the external. The speculation of the structure of this mind would be meaningless because of human inability to even understand its basic idea of integrity. Considerations of logical consistency, which the complete picture of the world should satisfy, prompt that they somehow interact. In this sense, they are also part of our "physical reality". Below I shall introduce some of the ideas that in my concern are needed to be found in correlation. There'll be introduced the horizon as the border of another, external, dark eternal contingencies that not being seen by outsiders. The brightest light that burns sub and un consciousness. Looking into dark dreams is a pleasant descending into nothingless, about which you can't say anything, but which gives us pleasure to the very sensation of impossibility. Forbidden intimacy, which is seemingly unreasonable due to the inability to violate the prohibition, due to lack of choice and self-awareness, will and opportunity, who will condemn the self-eradicating consciousness, groping for the horizon that does not exist. On the contrary, there is some naivete and purity inside any of it. You can always replace "Myself" with "No one". 

        p TODO : removal. In 1989, Konstantin Kedrov in his thesis "Poetic Cosmos" expounds the hypothesis of Metacode. He on numerous examples from fairy tales and mythological, religious plots, shows the existence of common patterns of the info strategy for building semantic series written on the pulsating language of cepheids, constellations and celestial objects. The general grammar of stars and the history of the human being in this case, the Celestial Map is the image of a planetary memory that knows nothing but continuity. This's the Celestial Book, this's the dimension in which the prophecies of the Oracles, the language of birds, act. He was trying to found connections with astronomical events such as phases of the moon, constellations and cyclic movements of stars -- all this for him unfolded inside myths, religions or works of art. Metacode acts like modern high-level translaters, translating texts of a language pair first into the internal language, onto the map of concepts, and afterwards to the second language of this pair. This Cosmos concept conducts an act of ritual dissemination of venomal agents that have become known in the media lately. The vein of the translating machine really is in this situation the primary language of the machines. It doesn't matter whether Kedrov's concept is true. It'll be relevant insofar as it's a paraphrase of a high-level translation. The very kosmos internal grid of the concepts of the transliterator is one of the images of the sky, Asgard, the Tree.

        p The XX century highlighted the discovery of the mythology of dreams as a special hyper-emergent non-spatial ideal structure projected onto the real memories of individual. It was the emergence of radical resonance of social structures, first of all singles, then groups, that laid the foundation for an adequate, abstract ordering of the mythology of dreams, devoid of entrenched hellenism in views on the dream mythology of 20th-century scolars and esoterics. The definition of the concept of hyper-emergence as a system factor, an order of magnitude greater than the totality of the components of the system, made it possible to comprehend the source of this scheme. This social structure emphasized not only memorization and comprehension of dreams, but also their connection within the real world. The key moment was the so-called feeding, which consisted in correlation of the real world with dream events and symbols. The ideas resulting from the isolation from the dream of all the components of a person's real life were not ideas derived from the noosphere model, but the ideas continuously supplied there. 

        p Much later, those avan-garde groups developed the concept of Orion as "the essence of the dream world", some imagined/dreamed matter projected onto the human consciousness as an indescribable feeling. Experiments on the allocation of Orion from the dream and its purification of the recharge matter led to the finding several hyper-resonant symbols (words, musical compositions, characters, synchronicity in time plans, et cetera), which at times increased the presence of Orion in reality. The number of those who are carried away by dreams has increased drastically. The colossal volumes of Orion began to distort the presence of matter. For the first time there were landmarked effects that allowed to distort not only the urban topographic schemes, but also the people's identities, and left "hyperlinks/flashbacks" in the past, allowing to make it a nonlinear structure. Further events weren't within the control of human self. After it was discovered that the Orion Pillars are described as living meta-beings, nothing was and could not be, the information increased its specific mass, turning into a viscous copper liquid. When the Cycle was completed, space-time assumed the heaviness of the new sructure. 

        p At the beginning of the XXI century, the matter of the world has already acquired the necessary plasticity. Quotes, retelling, reconstruction of other's systems and manifests lies ahead. Some might think of it as an attempt to place a wide diversity of theories into one single framework such as Wilber's Integral theory. Keep in mind that any section might deny the previous or on the contrary, so consider this being anything but classification. 

        .quote What we now call the crisis of Russian science is not a crisis only of Russian science. There is a crisis of world science. Real progress will consist in a very serious fight of science with religion, which will end with their unification. [V.Voevodsky]
