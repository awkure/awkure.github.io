The speculation of the structure of this mind would be meaningless because of human inability to even understand its basic idea of integrity. Considerations of logical consistency, which the complete picture of the world should satisfy, prompt that they somehow interact. In this sense, they are also part of our "physical reality". Below I shall introduce some of the ideas that in my concern are needed to be found in correlation. There'll be introduced the horizon as the border of another, external, dark eternal contingencies that not being seen by outsiders. The brightest light that burns sub and un consciousness. Looking into dark dreams is a pleasant descending into nothingless, about which you can't say anything, but which gives us pleasure to the very sensation of impossibility. Forbidden intimacy, which is seemingly unreasonable due to the inability to violate the prohibition, due to lack of choice and self-awareness, will and opportunity, who will condemn the self-eradicating consciousness, groping for the horizon that does not exist. On the contrary, there is some naivete and purity inside any of it. You can always replace "Myself" with "No one". </p><p>TODO : removal. In 1989, Konstantin Kedrov in his thesis "Poetic Cosmos" expounds the hypothesis of Metacode. He on numerous examples from fairy tales and mythological, religious plots, shows the existence of common patterns of the info strategy for building semantic series written on the pulsating language of cepheids, constellations and celestial objects. The general grammar of stars and the history of the human being in this case, the Celestial Map is the image of a planetary memory that knows nothing but continuity. This's the Celestial Book, this's the dimension in which the prophecies of the Oracles, the language of birds, act. He was trying to found connections with astronomical events such as phases of the moon, constellations and cyclic movements of stars -- all this for him unfolded inside myths, religions or works of art. Metacode acts like modern high-level translaters, translating texts of a language pair first into the internal language, onto the map of concepts, and afterwards to the second language of this pair. This Cosmos concept conducts an act of ritual dissemination of venomal agents that have become known in the media lately. The vein of the translating machine really is in this situation the primary language of the machines. It doesn't matter whether Kedrov's concept is true. It'll be relevant insofar as it's a paraphrase of a high-level translation. The very kosmos internal grid of the concepts of the transliterator is one of the images of the sky, Asgard, the Tree.</p><p>The XX century highlighted the discovery of the mythology of dreams as a special hyper-emergent non-spatial ideal structure projected onto the real memories of individual. It was the emergence of radical resonance of social structures, first of all singles, then groups, that laid the foundation for an adequate, abstract ordering of the mythology of dreams, devoid of entrenched hellenism in views on the dream mythology of 20th-century scolars and esoterics. The definition of the concept of hyper-emergence as a system factor, an order of magnitude greater than the totality of the components of the system, made it possible to comprehend the source of this scheme. This social structure emphasized not only memorization and comprehension of dreams, but also their connection within the real world. The key moment was the so-called feeding, which consisted in correlation of the real world with dream events and symbols. The ideas resulting from the isolation from the dream of all the components of a person's real life were not ideas derived from the noosphere model, but the ideas continuously supplied there. </p><p>Much later, those avan-garde groups developed the concept of Orion as "the essence of the dream world", some imagined/dreamed matter projected onto the human consciousness as an indescribable feeling. Experiments on the allocation of Orion from the dream and its purification of the recharge matter led to the finding several hyper-resonant symbols (words, musical compositions, characters, synchronicity in time plans, et cetera), which at times increased the presence of Orion in reality. The number of those who are carried away by dreams has increased drastically. The colossal volumes of Orion began to distort the presence of matter. For the first time there were landmarked effects that allowed to distort not only the urban topographic schemes, but also the people's identities, and left "hyperlinks/flashbacks" in the past, allowing to make it a nonlinear structure. Further events weren't within the control of human self. After it was discovered that the Orion Pillars are described as living meta-beings, nothing was and could not be, the information increased its specific mass, turning into a viscous copper liquid. When the Cycle was completed, space-time assumed the heaviness of the new sructure. </p><p>At the beginning of the XXI century, the matter of the world has already acquired the necessary plasticity. Quotes, retelling, reconstruction of other's systems and manifests lies ahead. Some might think of it as an attempt to place a wide diversity of theories into one single framework such as Wilber's Integral theory. Keep in mind that any section might deny the previous or on the contrary, so consider this being anything but classification. </p><div class="quote">What we now call the crisis of Russian science is not a crisis only of Russian science. There is a crisis of world science. Real progress will consist in a very serious fight of science with religion, which will end with their unification. [V.Voevodsky]</div><h3 class="sub">Memetics </h3><p>Nowadays memetics can be considered as a protoscience. Memetics underlies the explanation of human culture existing expressed in religion, politics, art, science -- all these areas develop with the consent of the theory of memes. Proceeding from the theory of Darwinism, meme is considered as the same replicator as gene. Also transmitted from person to person and capable of self-reproduction, with the difference only that the gene in a certain sense needs sexual contact, and meme -- informational. Memes are correlated with consciousness. It forces us to behave in certain situations. At the same time this is the only right behavior in which this meme can be transmitted to other recipients and infect them with a particular idea. With all the above meme doesn't need to be reliable, its priority -- fitness and relevance, infectiousness.</p><p>If a meme is an idea, then any idea is a kind of virus of the human consciousness, to which it can easily become infected without proper cognitive protection. A correctly selected viral meme (whether graphic, auditory, or a whole set of memes, such as ideology) will allow not only to infect a persons mind with a necessary idea, but even manipulate it, while the subject will distribute the meme further, through ordinary contact and communication with other people. Postulates of religions, political ideologies are the obvious instances. Due to Dawkins meme must be considered as a unit of information contained in the mind, which, influencing the course of certain events, promotes the appearance of its copies in other people.</p><p>The approach to the problem of the attitude of consciousness, proposed by Dennett, has a number of consequences. First, the possession of the brain doesn't mean possession of consciousness -- since consciousness appeared much later than the brain, secondly, functionally important features of consciousness can't be detected with the help of neuroanatomical analysis, therefore it's pointless for neuroscientists to rely on uncovering the mystery of consciousness through neuroanatomy. Consequently, due to Dennet, consciousness is considered as nothing more than a product of cultural evolution that occurs in the brain under the influence of memes.</p><p>Since consciousness is a product of the activity of memes, it becomes impossible to imagine an independent mind rebelling against them.</p><div class="quote">Man has the power to resist the influence of ... selfish memes received as a result of education ... We are built as machines for genes and cultivated as machines for memes, but we are able to turn against our creators. We are the only beings on earth capable of rebelling against the tyranny of selfish replicators. [R.Dawkins]</div><p>However, it would be unfair to ignore the fact that in a later work "The Extended Phenotype" Dawkins acknowledged that it's impossible to imagine a person opposed to their genetic and memetic creators. Thus, we come to one of the most provocative ideas that have emerged due to the formation of memetics. He states that neither "Myself" nor freedom of will really exists. </p><p>The ability in creativity is also an illusory fraud.</p><div class="quote">Memes, as soon as they appear, become independent of the author and critic, however much we like to think that we create our ideas and control them.</div><p>Susan Blackmore states that the personality is a huge set of memes, and people, if you look at them from the point of view of memes - are nothing but mememachines. It may seem to a person that he has his own thoughts, beliefs, creates individual ideas, has his own Ego - in fact, all these are memes, and ideas are not created by them, but are only saved and transmitted. The fact that a person can not help thinking is also a merit of memes. They force him to a constant internal dialogue, creating an illusion of the stream of consciousness, and then to the external dialogue leading to the spread of memes into the minds of other people. This leaves us the question of free will. With regard to this issue, Dennett and Blackmore were also skeptical. According to Dennett, the only freedom that a person has is freedom to foresee the undesirable consequences of his actions, thus, to avoid them. The position of Blackmore in relation to free will is such that there's nothing terrible in that a person is, in essence, a huge memecomplex. All that a person can do is analyzing his own convictions and trying to identify and eliminate the most harmful memes that are ingrained in his mind. One of the most viable, widespread, harmful and powerful memecomplexes, according to all the main representatives of the memetic movement, is religion. The problem is that people are especially sensitive precisely to religious memes, so religion is so all-encompassing, common to all cultures and almost ineradicable phenomenon.</p><h3 class="sub">Urbanism</h3><p>From urbanistic point of view it's the type of existence of a citizen. It's firstly the love to the City itself, the City as a habitat -- with all its unexpected corners, dynamism, rhythms, routes of pigeons, with its hidden passages and strains between spaces. All its symbolism forms a rhythm of attention and influences our perception as emergence. The City grows on its own, creating spatial catastrophes, topological paradoxes and Mobious strips. </p><p>The City in general refers to one of those systems that is so immeasurably stronger than we are intellectually tat the infinitely complex and intertwinded "rules" of interaction between systems seem to us as the will of chance. The city migth be compared with Solaris -- a sentient being so semi-detached from our existence that, no matter how you try, you can not across the bridge of understanding to his ideas and logic. Tyche-urbanism is one of the practices of urban druidism. It is purely postmodern, but not counter-culturally: it is a strategy of deep disguise, not rebellion and destruction. Masking welcomes the status quo. It is postmodern in the sense that it goes far beyond the scientistic and intellectualist dogmas of modernity.</p><div class="quote">Anyone who becomes a worm can then complain that it was crushed?</div><p>To instantiate just remember that people several millenia ago lived in a world where laws of basic logic were not yet discovered, where the idea of syllogism would have need a careful scrutiny by the skeptics/philosophers. How was it living in a world that didn't obey the unchanging constitution? Living in a kaleidoscope that was forever changeable, vague. Kaleidoscope's insides are close to a dynamic system that forms chaos. Nowadays kaleidoscopes are made for the amusement, for people that are pleaset to look at the colorful ornaments, that provokes their caviar orgasm. So, the world where was not unity of cause and consequence and anything could become the consequence of anything. The world that in rare cases was supportive to provoke the same actions that brought the same results. But in conversations, wars, junting, life in society and wild nature, people were constantly convinced that nothing does not follow from anything. Cages from nothing. Nothing is the space without metaphysics. There could be something, but without the proper perceptions it's impossible to recognize, not because of limited perception of the subject, but because of the very structure of nothing. </p><p>The person at that moment existed inside a fractal forest, considering his poisition inside the universe was completely subordinate, surrounded by undiscovered symbolizm, God. The world was stronger than him both physically and intellectually leaving him with no choice but to admit the intellectual defeat to the world. Nowadays nothing changed. </p><p>Moving further on the path of evolution man groped for a real tresure. There was three figures that changed the world that created most successfull cult on the planet, surpassing Christianity in popularity. Those people were called Aristotle, Bacon and Pythagoras. Aristotle tried to teach his fellow citizens to be more politically and legaly "effective". He developed the codex of thinking, reflexcting reality like a magnificent mirror. This codex is called "logic". Politicians, lawyer of that time could dominate their opponents in the eyes of the audience by using Aristotle's teachings. However, the brainchild of Aristotle got much greater fame than if it remained among politicians and lawyers. Logic in a short period of time turned from into the language that God speaks. By adding a bit of axioms to the logic and you will get math. Some time after Aristocle one person experienced a deep religious experience, refleccting on his ideas -- he opened discovered that the whole world is written in the language of mathematics _and_ logic. The whole universe is mathematics, manifestend in a specific way. This man was called Pythagoras, his religious cult became very popular during the time. This was the peak of human development at the time. </p><p>A thousand years passed by, the Christianity after Pythagoras was experienced by every human at the time, humanity has caught the trend on the entire ancient Greek culture and teachings. This newfangled trend attracted man people to the Pythagorean ideas. By the beginning of Renaissance the Christian God, according to the european philosophers, loved creators and heroes. God has placed man -- his perfect creation -- in the head of the universe and welcomed his attempts to rule the living and non-living. It is the science that is given to humanity by God as the ideal tool to tame the universe. This idea was expressed by Francis Bacon. Mankind has taken up this idea and experienced the stunning upsurge. "Forset" has become a "house". Human suddenly became stronger than the world, both intellectually and physically, zero-sum game has chenged to a slightly positive sum game in a matter of years. The world kaleidoscope has started turning into a world-clock mechanism.</p><p>The theory of evolution questioned the idea that logic and intellect were given by God to ideally represent a model of the world. Some people had to be forced with doubt that man is generally driven by reason, as he desperately continues to assert. Yes, there're some flaws in the House, but for the most part everything is available to a person. He can become anyone: a mathematician, physicyst, biologist -- he could classify, experiment and gain new knowledge of the deep reality. The mirror of logic is ideal, flawless, reflects the world. Logic is a bridge, stretched between reality and intellect. This is the opinion of most civilized people now. If you propose that modern has dien long ago, few shall believe, because it turns out that it's very difficult to believe that science and logic no longer satisfy the cognitive interest of the individual. The individual lives in his segment of percepted reality and is forced to solve problems that are too insignificant for the passing train of modern science. These problems -- social, behavioral, economic -- shall not find an exhausitive answer in scientific articles. His problems are often illogical and absurd. A person leaves the house and goes to the outer city -- from the "house" to the "city" -- and sees that around him the illogical people are making illogical choices, forming an illogical reality. Moreover, his own perceptions and choices are no less illogical and paradoxal than others, forcing himself to be perfectly logical, a man breaks increasingly with the world around him and with himself.</p><p>A believing person, confronted with facts that don't correspond to his beliefs, includes the mechanism of psychological defense -- denial of the obvious, he inventes convincing explanations, chooses the only suitable statistics and distracts his attention from innapropriate. So does any person who believes tht his life is guided by a scientific approach. The city forces him to deny the facts, find excuses, hat himself even more and continue to believe in his own picture which hangs in his imagination. The house of a person becomis his prison and his reality becomes a city -- a place that isn't stronger than a person physically, but certainly immeasurably stronger than him intellectually. </p><p>To a man who lives in the world of "scientific and progressive time" this pamphlet against intellect may seem as regressive delirium of a religious confessor that stuck in dark ages. The intellectual elit of modernity as a whole has already discarded modernism as a non-working philosophical construction, cultic thinking around ideas that are born in mankind about how the world should be perceived. Modernism gave us material wealth and exntended the average life expactancy by 30 years. Nobody calls for getting rid of science and returning to live in the "_forest_", however, human intellect has groped its own boundaries more than a half century ago. If the structure is let into consciousness like a wandering demon, the science of connections, the basic myths and the proto-languages, the unity of plants shall unfold before the mind, the escape from prison shall merge into a single intention of eternal return, soft forms will be linked with grammars. The hallucinating structure is free from bodily laws, it can communicate much, it sees as it sees. The examination of hallucinating structures is something that poststructuralism has been burdened with since its inception. The valuable position of charmed-disillusioned poststructures is the position of the hallucinating subjectness of another storehouse -- plant, animal -- while preserving the sense of the human language. To become a forest, dreaming of its interior, of its inhabitants. The language should be left with you, even with a complete rash of consciousness. Otherwise, how to tell the world about your new situation. This will be a message to yourself, perhaps to yourself, the past, to someone who hasn't yet been able to speak to birds.</p><p>On the one hand these are material boundaries -- modernism hasn't made us happier, it hasn't mae us more confident in the future, material wealth hasn't made us more satisfied with life -- if that happened it's that we became more embittered, more withdrawn and alienated and finally more obsessed with depression and existentally lost. On the other hand these are logical boundaries. Science has unequivocally proved that our actions are guided by unconscious process. From ontological moint of view our intellect only receives some information and simulates a specific noema to characterize the perceived object. Later I shall discuss this phenomenon more precisely in the next section. But stated grotesque and brief science has proved that the brain that does not see the "full" picture of reality evolutionally wins, but observes an illusion that allows it to effectively survive and multiply. Also science has proved that any mathematical system contains fundamentally unprovable statemets. In scientific articles, there's a well-founded suspicion that the various observed phenomena aren't a consequence of dark matter, but a consequence of the fundamental inconsistency of the laws of physics. M-theory is severly criticized for using anthropic principle, which doesn't allow the use of falsification criterion. </p><p>Once again, the meaning of foregoing is different -- Modernism isn't just a deep crisis -- it has long been intellectuially buried.Tyche-urbanism begins already "beyond the edge" -- where all the above is a known fact, as a matter of course. "Forest-house-city" is the concept of tyche-urbanism which shows the possible vector of further development of the human intellect. From a world in which everything is supposedly understandable to us, we, confessing honestly in our own illusions, are returning to the world where "the earth is lost underfoot" -- to a world of paradoxes, elements, systems that are subject of "logic" that's infinitely far away from us to understand. Boldly going into the world without cultural codes and stereotypes, we find ourselves inside kalediodoscope of the city.</p><h3 class="sub">Neoplatonism </h3><p>The whole intelligible world and its creatures cast their shadows on the essence of dreams, only leveling out the layer of relief of patterned structure, which the rat, as if it knows something, looks at the subject that was tied inside a Plato's cave within the hope of turning its head toward the light source. The concept of true God realization cannot be fully determined. The ordinary view on the cliffs, the sky, the nearest trees, but something seems to stop you from concentrating on them. Something flashes before very eyes. It's like a little fly. Pleroma. Then you realize that it doesn't exists between objects, but rather is huge and covers them. The figure is so alien that if you translate your look for a while you shall feel inconvenience, as if you are looking at an object that's too close, out of focus. Trained by the usual images of the eyes can't learn anything and object appears to you first as a column of moving rock. Then - a boa entwinding the rock... This lasts at least five seconds, and only then you finally realize. What? The blast wave struck all your perceptory organs. The mind became completely empty. You disappeared into a hurricane of information that doesn't have time to freeze in images, sweeping them away, producing the associations of damaged space.</p><p>Here's the part when your very life splits into parts "before" and "after". After removing the provocative code, consciousness collapses into the necessary layer, protective crusts fly off. It's exposed and allows itself to e fed with broken junk. There're patterns, magical associations, naked consciousness that looks for a new clothes, wrapped in what they give, eaths what they feed. The magic of these associations is quickly accepted by consciousness and can be quickly discarded as well. There'sn't just a dump from the rhytm, but rather a plunge into the noise, a roar, the sound with all creaks and rattles. </p><p>So, sensation of recognition arose only for a second. And the picture is blurred again. The terrifying horror and delight were replaced by a doubt in what you learned earlier than you had time to comprehend the image and write it onto one of the catalogs of the ordinary objects that the mind used to perceive. It makes a perfect sense why on the images of the most ancient and most terrible Gods of the Gentiles were depicted without any form. Or they were made up from different parts of bodies of different animals, things, natural phenomena. This's the attempt to portray the image that can't be depicted. You can also note the canvases of the cubists or surrealists and have a bit of understanding of what actually Silvador Dali or Kazimir Malevich tried to find. To fix the angels, to sketch the light of the mountain? To create new temples with new icons or to add a psychedelic allegory to the personal affairs with which we will work when we finally reach Heaven?</p><p>Movement, overflow, complexity of this spectacle aren't accessible to the mechanism of perception of our eyes. The pupil of the beholder rushes around the figure of the visible object to gather it together in the view, even if the figure simply begins to change its shape quickly enough. It will already become impossible for a person, to "see" technically means "stop seeing" and begin to analyze. But what if there's an object that you can't stop seeing? Then it will be inaccessible to our sight. Gods and angels aren't invisible. Not incorporeal. They're too visible so much that they destroy the machine of our perception (the same as pleroma for instance). This sight dazzles. The analogy with the sun is also often used by initiates, but the sun is just a banal metaphor. The sun has an unusual brightness, poorly compatible with our visual perception. If you look at the sun, it can destroy your eyes. This is their similarity.</p><p>The facing of the macrobe can be compared with the sensation of a man who fell under a stone avalanche. It's irresistible. Only these sensations aren't tactile, but visual. Nothing, except direct collision with macrobes, can convey this experience. If one sees, he won't be prepared for what will happen to him. This is an attempt to convey something that can't be conveyed. Those means look ridiculous for those who compare their look with kind of familiar things. They look threatening for those who know what the painter tried to depict, what hint they contain. Inexpressible, absurd. The invisible. Unspeakable. Tetragrammaton. Images of faceless Gods. Incredible geometric shapes. Symbols and ordinances that can not be understood by our perceptions.</p><p>Theosophy draws on Neoplatonic emanationism, in particular the concept of separation from and return to the Absolute, and reworks the Eastern concepts of karma and reincarnation to provide an evolutionary theory of both humankind and the universe. In brief by the principle of emanatianism, "_ex nihil_" is being proposed, the aeons are emanations of the divine universal Monad and Christ is one of them. Pleroma, according to Valentia, is the region of light constituting "_the fullness of the Godhead_". The lowest aeon, Sofia (wisdom), is responsible for the transformation of material metaspace. Distributed hierarchically from a single Father-God, aeons have a property to degrade. Panexperientialism (or "panprotopsychism"), and "panprotoexperientialism" are related concepts. Panexperientialism is associated with the philosophies of Charles Hartshorne and Alfred North Whitehead, although the term itself was invented by David Ray Griffin in order to distinguish the process philosophical view from other varieties of panpsychism.</p><p>The soul, as a moving essence, generates the corporeal or phenomenal world. This world ought to be so pervaded by the soul that its various parts should remain in perfect harmony. Plotinus is no dualist in the same sense as sects like the Gnostics. In contrast, he admires the beauty and splendour of the world. So long as idea governs matter, or the soul governs the body, the world is fair and good. It is an image – though a shadowy image – of the upper world, and the degrees of better and worse in it are essential to the harmony of the whole. But, in the actual phenomenal world, unity and harmony are replaced by strife or discord. The result is a conflict, a becoming and vanishing, an illusive existence. And the reason for this state of things is that bodies rest on a substratum of matter. Matter is the indeterminate: that with no qualities. If destitute of form and idea, it is evil. As capable of form, it is neutral. Evil here is understood as a parasite, having no-existence of its own (parahypostasis), an unavoidable outcome of the Universe, having an "other" necessity, as a harmonizing factor.</p><p>The Divine Intelligence is the first manifestation of the Absolute, the true beginning of the world, without which the creation of the world would be impossible. One of the cardinal differences of this Intelligence is, as is known in Tradition, in the principle of super-rational instantaneous comprehension, in principle of all-pervasiveness and the "blazing" knowledge of everything that exists or what attention is drawn to. The closest analogue to this is the Intuitive Intellect, which knows existence not by analysis, but by instant awareness and identification with the object of consciousness. This is a bit like the work of art people, writers, poets, skilled artists or the intuitive gnosis of mystics and contemplatives. But even this is only a shadow analogue in relation to the Divine Intelligence, for which there is in general no "_object of knowledge_", for Him contains all knowledge as immanent, including knowledge of all worlds -- in any of their temporal-spatial variants -- simultaneously. Therefore, it is clear that the very exposition of what is related to the Divine Intelligence is conditional, in the sense that there're no words expressing this reality using human language. The next stage of emanation is the formation of countless worlds. It's therefore the universe as a whole, with all its "_visible and invisible_" levels and sublevels, where different layers can not entwine with each other.</p><h3 class="sub">The last doctrine</h3><p>There's a tendency in people having a caviar orgasms while stimulating their interests in life by horrifying themself. The trivial instance is a modern journalism. As Eugene Golovin once said</p><div class="quote">One of the problems of the modern world is that the blood of myth has dried up, that is, life has turned into a boring waste of time. </div><p>Because of this we are constantly in search of a variety of doping to entrain ourself. However, along with this humans ignore the concept of the total horror which is always be in front of us, our human being. It's unrecognisable because of the deep allusion of life. Perhaps our oblivion and blindeness to this horror is one of its faces for you to agree that it's a radical invasion of the "_strange_" into a built-up structure of the "_normal_", that is, for the horror to become terror, some support, organized from chaos.</p><p>The horror from that point behaves like a context. It's present in one mode and is absent in another. It also has no particular direction. You can move around, you just need to get used to, snatch a common rhythm, you can roll on the grid, flow along the edges. When you are perceived as a pattern, there's nothing left to do but start playing, pretending to be perceived like this by someone else. You'ren't a rat, but the organization of contexts, an ornament inside flickering ligaments. It also feels the hidden sun, unnecessary external lighting. When the movement begins, the optimal tracks on the grid appear and it's difficult to restrain ourselves, we have to move forward and not that without understanding the direction, but even without understanding the difference between "inside" or "outside". </p><div class="quote">The boundaries of your being are very blurry. Movement by itself is a pulsating change of configuration, the ratio of empathy.</div><p>So the horror breaks out when our perceptions and concepts suddenly collapse when it becomes obvious through direct experience that everything isn't quite what has been imagined. Genesis by itself is absurd and seriousness with regard to being is a part of this absurdity. This madness is especially heated in time, when most people are forced to believe in the most stable nowadays scientific system, that is, the popular scientific illusion of understanding how everything is arranged.</p><p>The casual questions like: "What is beyond the universe?", "Where's the universe and everything included in it?", "Where and when did the Big Bang happen?", "When did the time begin?" -- all of them slowly approach the boundaries of Terror, the supersensible Abyss of transcendental genesis. Thus it's obvious to come to the conclusion that there's a global flaw in this model. Not to mention such a method analysis and thinking about your personal human being and questions like "What was before and shall be after my birth?". </p><p>As the result of such reflections, you begin to feel a sense of something ineffable and supercomplex, something that is the basis of being. Being is infinitely wider than that boring oblivion named life. While this horror informs that there's something radically different and that being as such is only a hint of this other, which is a true nothing, a hint of an impossible existence beyond all limits. </p><p>The evolution of man on Earth proceeds within matter, time and space. Given to consciousness, these three categories form a unity, the primal state of which is the highest Trinity.Their interrelation is dynamic and is carried out in the hierarchical order of the action of forces and substances. We subject it to analysis in the state that is characteristic of it at the present and subsequent stages of the development of man and the Earth. Both components of the material form of being: space and time, are not equivalent. The initial extent between them is space. Where inside of some finds his last expression, reflection, descending through the stages of being and consciousness, the higher Divine Trinity. Atma, Buddhi and Manas.In the evolution of the world, in the state that preceded the aeon of ancient Saturn, there was, only space. Neutral world fire was merged within the metarality, which, in fact, poured out and limited the thermal substance of ancient Saturn. This space was nothing more than a spirit.</p><p>{% include image.html path="images/ab-omnibus/1.png" path-detail="images/ab-omnibus/1.png" alt="" %}</p><p>There's something incredibly symbolic in that ψῡχή at the same time means the afterlife and, strangely enough, life as such. </p><p>The very essence of tradition leads to the fact that the transcendence of God is fundamentally illusory. In fact, there's nothing closer to man than God itself for in its highest manifestation, man ceases to be a man and becomes what he's in reality, that is, God. God turns out to be an absolutely immanent to man, or to be more precise, practically identical. His transcendence is based, therefore, on ignorance, literally a metaphysical fraund, on maya, without which it's impossible to create anything. The destruction of metaphysical ignorance, the destruction of the false identification of oneself with one's body, mind and ψῡχή leads to the true essense of a person, or rather one who so calls himself, hidden behind the veil of falsible knowledge of the universe. The destruction of this false knowledge is the destruction of all false ideas about the ethernal God-like essence, because the idea of its transcendence is based on this, which most often, especially in dualistic religious systems implying a fatal gap between God and a man that leads to inevitable hidden idolatry.</p><div class="quote">Therefore, ascending to God means the end of all religions [Y.Mamleev].</div><p>This coming means in addition the acquisition of one's true "Myself" as the source of eternal life and immortality. This acquisition means an unconditional victory over the concept of death and its afterwards. This God's essense is immanent, which was spoken of by Christian mystics and scholars for a very long time. The concept of true transcendence is at the same time as paradoxal, but is a cornerstone of men's existence. Indeed, one can say that a person always aspires to go beyond what been achieved, even beyond the realized. The ascending beyond the limits of God, beyond the Absolute means ascending the very concept of metaphysical reality, that is, beyond the so-called Diving Naught and which as such, on the other side of being. Being is contained inside the Divine Nothing (caged in nothingless) in its unmanifested, hidden state. For in God there's no dualis, on the contrary, a metaphysical unity. He's one by his so-called "_essence_". I'm leading to the point that the God is only the body of a truly transcendent and not its essence. In relation to God, this darkness is the same as the Spiritual relation with the body. The initiation into the Last Doctrine (in its first aspect) should begin with the realization that the liberation of being or the realization of the Absolute means the attainment of the highest peace of happiness and immersion in himself while the last doctrine begins with the principle of eternal transcendence, the eternal event horizon. The horizon -- which is the line of war, beyond of which a men has nothink to think about, consciousness dissolves inside a rat's imagination.</p><p>It's necessary to break away from our absolute eternal principle, firstly realizing it. And the first stage of this separation is a return from the sphere of the realized Absolute - to the world on the periphery of being, for it is there, and not in the triumphant fullness of the absolute, that it is possible to find some misconceptions inside the Abyss, lying beyond the absolute. Thus, this determines the higher meaning of the existence of our fenced world and the higher meaning of the creation of the world: for not in the blinding light of the absolute, but in the world of suffering and negations, a breakthrough in the abyss is possible. The initiation into the Last Doctrine (in its first aspect) should begin with the realization that the liberation of being or the realization of the Absolute means the attainment of the highest peace of happiness and immersion in himself while the last doctrine begins with the principle of eternal transcendence, the eternal event horizon. The horizon -- which is the line of war, beyond of which a men has nothink to think about, consciousness dissolves inside a rat's imagination. The initiation into the abyss doesn't cancel the previous initiation into the absolute, but, on the contrary, assumes it. Pnly by acquiring the true immortal self you can venture into a monstrous metaphysical voyage to the unknown. The ascending from the wholeness to periphery is essentially an independent initiation and at the same time a vestibule of initiation into the abyss, a vest still within the world of the Absolute, within Genesis. Hence, the movement into the eternal Darkness, into the Abyss can be understood on the basis of the principle of eternal deprivation.</p><p>Being is what one knows about one way or another for even manifestation is knowledge about oneself. At the same time, inside the trans-darkness of the principle of self-manifestation, there isn't any. Everything seems to become self-realized. This complete otherworldness towards oneself (the absolute absence of immanence) also means, among other things, the absence of being and it defines a new principle of Night. More significance lies inside the transfiguration of the real world. The essence of which lies in the possibility of being to have its shadow. The full transfiguration doesn't particulary mean anything much, however, it's surrelization or symbolizm -- for such a whole relates to the world of reality, where behind the objects lies their eternal essence, the symbols of which they actually are. Here no one is hiding behind the world even relatively real, can't be a symbol of what is not, but, on the contrary, the ineffable power of trans-darkness casts its shadow on the embodied world turning it into its antianalog, antisymbol, entering into an absurdist-paradoxical relationship with it. Thus, the being of the Abyss is a participant in this transfiguration. The God that ascends into the endless Night might gone mad, blaschemer. But such a departing, remaining God, isn't only God, because his immanent Infantis is changing as this contact with darkness. </p><p>That paradoxal being that comes into contact with the Abyss simultaneously includes both absolute completeness and absolute deprivation and the will to death as well as immortality and self-preservation and also the risk of self-destruction -- the absolute narcissism because of the essence of the true paradox of many paradoxes that comes into this text. And even the very fact of its existence can be questioned for in its the most important aspect that it transcends the reality, beyond the world of absolute, reminding the reader of Kantian jargon.</p><h3 class="sub">Monad </h3><p>Whilst Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ponders about the essense of the substance an then he comes to the directly opposite conclusion. He believes that there're infinitely many substances. The doctrine of the plurality of substances is called pluralism. Behind every wholeness in the metauniverse such as atom, molecule, a living cell or a whole person there's its own individual substance which by itself considered as a highest center of integration of all manifestations of this integrity. Leibniz proposed the term "Monad" for such individual substances. They're indivisible, intangible centers of activity, pleroma.</p><p>Each monad itself has all information about its existence and surroundings integrated inside. And so each monad contains all the information about the metauniverse and, due to Leibniz, it's called "_perception_" -- inside each monad only a part of this information is manifested and processed as in the form of an image of the world and its own manifestations. Such manifestation is a part of the perception, which is perceived as a monad is called aperception. All monads have the same composition of perceptions, but all monads differ inthe volume and type of their aperceptions. Moreover this is the only thing monads can be differentiated by so there cannot be two different monads with the same apperception and this principle is called "_The principle of identity indistinguishable_". Relying on the Greek etymology of the word entelechie, Leibniz posits quantitative differences in perfection between monads which leads to a hierarchical ordering. </p><p>The more perceptions are manifested, the more complex the information gets integrated inside a monad and the more complex it is for itself, revealing a more complex world around itself. Monads with unmanifested perceptions or a very small number of them manifest themselves as inorganic bodies whilist monads with more developed ones begin to manifest as living beings -- fistly as plants, then as animals / humans. All monads are in continuous development -- inside them the volume of manifested perceptions constantly increases and thus they rise on the ladder of evolution. At the top of this ladder is the highest monad in which all perceptions are manifested. It's the monad of God -- the unity as the absolute of the universal one -- Aiōn Teleos. Through a process of emanation, various divine entities and realms emerge from the One (id est by the virtue of the principle of identity indistinguishable) at the end of world evolution.</p><p>From this emerges the theory of so-called pre-established harmony which also solver the mind-body problem, but at the cost of declaring any interaction between substances as a mere appearance. Leibniz claims that monads cannot enter into any relations with others because of their nature, otherwise it will become dependednt and cease to be a substance. Due to this Leibniz puts forward the concept of pre-established harmony. He asserts that every monad, apart from its nature encoded inside the substance, has the completely determined prehistory of its future existence from the very beginning to the end of the world time. And all these programs are synchronized with each other (id est there's their "pre-established harmony"). </p><p>From tihs an internal contradiction arises in Lebniz's theory. One can identify synchronization only by looking at monads from the outsitde and consequently compare them with each other. Leibniz believed that God could do this, which synchronized all the monads and made them completely isolated. At leas God could determine them from the outside (due to the observer paradox from quantum mechanics which I shall describe in more precise in future posts) proving the pre-established harmony and determining the current state of the universe. As we see that Spinoza was right -- if there're many substances, then these are no longer absolute, that must be completely isolated from each other. </p><p>In the theory of cognition, Leibniz distinguished two kinds of truth -- the truth of reason and the truth of act. They provide the mind completeness and the negations of which are contradictions -- something impossible. The basis of the truth of the truths of the mind is the only formal logic with its own postulates of identity and non-contradiction. As for the truths of the fact, they have a different basis. These are truths the negation of which isn't a contradiction from the logical point of view. Such truths of which can not be established purely logically and for its establishment one must turn to experience were called Leibniz "_truths of fact_".</p><p>Due to gnoistic point of view the simplest explanation that could be given as to what our Monad actually is, would be to say that it is a Divine Spark or Ray, an individualised “breath” of the Absolute, a manifestation of the infinite Energy of the One Universal Monad. These are of course only words, until we gain that understanding and intuitional perception which far surpasses mere words and intellect. Nevertheless, these words above present only a small part of the story of what exactly is the Monad. So, monad is a derivative of the conjuction of the two supreme principles -- Atma and Buddhi, which make up a person as a whole with the spirit. In fact, the very mission of the rebirth of Manas is unification with the monad, which in itself is the highest source of spiritual essence and perception. Later Neoplatonic Philosophers and idealists like Plotinus treated the dyad as a second cause (Demiurge), which was the divine mind (nous) that via a reflective nature (finiteness) causes matter to "appear" or become perceivable.</p><p>When one begins to go even deeper into the study of the Theosophical teachings, however, it becomes apparent that there's in fact far more to the subject of the Monad than this. Apparently contradictory and confusing statements begin to emerge, particularly in the two volumes of “The Secret Doctrine,” and especially so when one discovers the numerous references to the Monad in relation to astrological aspects such as the seven sacred planets and the twelve constellations or signs of the Zodiac. We also see that the Monad is perhaps not quite as absolutely impartite and universal as we may have thought. It seems to be something individual in its nature, yet universal in its essence. As HPB remarked, it is “_a mystery_”.</p><p>That period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man manifests, is called involution. Its purpose is to slowly carry life lower and deeper into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, till the nadir of materiality is reached. From that point, life begins to ascend into higher Worlds. This succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience, is called "spiritual evolution". As an example, the so-called descent of the Monad into matter means an involution or involving or infolding of spiritual potencies into material vehicles which coincidentally and contemporaneously, through the compelling urge of the infolding energies, unfold their own latent capacities, unwrap them, roll them forth; and this is the evolution of matter. </p><h3 class="sub">Ego </h3><p>(TOREMOVE) Cartesian formula "_Cogito ergo sum_" also might be considered in it's inverted way "_Non cogito ergo sum_". The absolute Self is hidden behind the curtain of the thought process, the entire process that is tied to the phenomenalogical world, is simply Its projection. "_Not to think_" and at the same time "_being_" means to manifest the highest activity of transcendent Silence, that means to "_experience_" not a chain of thoughts, but a pure basis of the thinking metareality, freed from differentiated thoughts. Ultimately this means realizing the eternal source of thought itself and penetrating into the divine nothingless, which is tantamount of the total potentiality of everything.</p><p>Due to Husserl, the real world is reduced to a world that's a correlate of our mental acts which constitutes it. All that is transcendent is in brackets, together with the objects of our acts. The remnant, purified from the whole transcendal Husserl, calls transcendental. Thus, the phenomenological reduction leads us from the transcendal to the transcendental.</p><p>In addition to post-being, we are also interested in pre-existence. We used to think of Earth as the only place to dwell, but this is far from the true. The Earth isn't hell, but obviously not the most peaceful place - it's more like a training ground where the souls learn to realize their fantasies and communicate. Children have a very clear understanding of the structure of the world, unfortunately, they are rarely asked the right questions. But it happens that the childish babble of parents is noted as something very structured, very clear in wording. Children - until the moment of socialization - have an understanding of what was before birth, they are deprived of the fear of death, they have an understanding of their nature, which can only be explained by membering. Every person undergoes socialization as a break-up, when your original principles are replaced by those imposed from outside.</p><p>Such a view often shown as a contradiction with the principle of Hegelian philosophy, the beginning of which is relied on in the category of being, which "_can neither be felt nor contemplated nor imagined_". This primordial being, according to Hegel, is identically "_nothing_". </p><div class="quote">Beginning is not pure nothing, but such nothing from which something must happen, being is already contained in the beginning Beginning is the unity of being and nothingness, in other words, it is non-being, which is at the same time, paradoxically, being, which is at the same time non-being</div><p>If we ask ourselves what is the beginning, then in the aspect of the history of philosophy (including its gnostic-theological branch) is the beginning of ontology. Hegel put the category of being at the beginning of logic, which made a new step in philosophy. But in part of it is the weak side of his system. Remaining completely in the logical, Hegel tries to solve the riddle of existence, although definitely does not speak about it anywhere. On the one hand, he claims that his "_empty being_" is the beginning and it is "_essence_", on the other hand, that "_the beginning is the logical beginning_", as such, it "_forms the beginning_".</p><p>So to remark the concept of individuality. This concept, meaning "_specificity_", "_distinctiveness_", is inevitably connected with the idea of ​​form, since the difference must be clothed in form in order to obtain this differentiation, regardless of whether it means the customary the form of terrestrial beings or the more "_flexible_" or "_subtle_" form of beings of the periphery. Although the basis of the so-called creation of the world is transcendental deception, but on the other hand according to the Vedanta, the world isn't just an illusion, but a metaphysical one. Consequently, sufferings of those who didn't come out of the closed ring of incarnations are quite real for them.</p><p>Fractal (MOVE TO CHAOS) </p><p>The principle of fractal lies inside genome of living organisms, the planetary model of the atom, the very principle of pulsation. On closer inspection it turns out that all the symbols of different religions and esoteric scholars teachings also contain elements of fractal design. The external architectural sphere-cube-pyramidal for of Eurasion Christion monasteries, Buddhist datsans and temples, Islamic mosques, Egyptian pyramids, et cetera, contain the same fractal basis - a three-dimensional cross and unfolding from it inscrived inside a cuve an octahedron that transforms into a sphere. Fractal forms are not a symbol of fundamental technology, but on the contrary, fundamental esoteric technology is a manifestation of fractal structure of the information basis of Metauniverse.</p><div class="quote">The eye could never perceive the sun if it weren't like the sun: in the same way, the soul can't see the beautiful until it's beautiful itself [Plotinus]</div><div class="quote">ASC is the state in which the transformations of the subject's semantic spaces take place, the changes in the form of categorization, accompanied by the transition from socially-standardized forms of categorization to new ways of ordering internal experiences [A.Rossokhin]</div><p>Any movement is a change in the spacial position of something that exists. Time is a kind of movement about which we perceive certain processes and objects. We can observe that every movement is an increase in the number of changes in reality, producing entropy. We can observe that such movement is everywhere (such as quantum fluctations). If we theoretically went to the begginning of everything throught the passage of time the it's noticable that the entropy decreases and tends to zero. How does anything could happened from this point of nothingless? There's a tendency to suppose that the movement was always there but once was infinitely small. The concept of Jung's syncronicity, the correlation between planetary models of atom and Solar System are also needs to be noticed. In brief thoughts attract events of life. Every infinitesimal object of reality has the basic property curving 4th dimensional space-time cone and leading to attracting to each other. Suppose a space inside of which the particles are distributed. For the observer they are immobilized. When they were attracted to each other the first figure of a fractal was formed. Fractal of attraction (P) and repulsion (E), depending on a large <charge> of a particle. This new, coalesced particle with a predominant <charge>, say, E, attracts particles P around. Repels E. Repulsive E approaching the other P, which were nearby, but the <charge> of which wasn't enough for rapprochement before. Consider this for the time being. What happens to it. Attracting new P, at some point it changes its <charge> and begins to attract E around and repel P. This dynamic system extends to all being. That is, by inertia. They grow by changing their <charge> from E to P. That is, pulsation. </p><p>Those clumps of matter inside the dark eternal nothingless posses the described properties. Imagine that at some point these pulsating clusters of <charges> become the size of not just more than Earth, Sun, the Galaxy. They're more than the universe itself. And they create a directed movement of particles around them. That is, it'sn't necessary to move particles around their radius. Displacement can become narrow-vectored. A big explosion in the framework of this hypothesis is the meeting of two pulses, spreading from giant clod-charges. That's why the expansion began so rapidly. These impulses, which have great strength, as a consequence of the change in the state of the lump from E to P, met at some point in space. And this impulse continues. Therefore, the universe rotates and expands, since two vectors emanating from those sources of impulse attract the attractors located between them. The rotation of the Universe, and everything inside, continues with a constant impulse of <charged> clumps. Pulsation goes through the universe. This pulsation is a continuation of the build-up of attraction-repulsion fractals. Which at a certain stage of their development generates patterns in the form of a planetary atomic structure, then the planetary system itself. Then, in the form of organic. In the form of consciousness.</p><div class="quote">And God said, Let us make man in our image after our likeness...

Quantum Psychology integrated Western Psychology, Advaita-Vedanta's Non-duality, Quantum Physics, Neuro-Science, Kashmir Shaivism, Self Enquiry and Buddhism. The purpose of Quantum Psychology was to act as a trajectory enabling the realization of the One Mind, or Consciousness (Quantum Consciousness), or Buddha Mind, (Emptiness)*. Quantum Psychology attempted to update many of the ancient cultural metaphors and pointers bringing them into present time language thus making "their understanding" more accessible.</p><p>The problem of deep reality dates back when D.Bohm tried to explain quantum paradoxes in his thesis. For the present, actuality in means something that human can experience, so "_deep reality_" means something that we can only talk in terms of our perceptions. Existentialism, deals with what humans can experience, "deep reality" belongs to the pre-existential Platonic or Aristotelian doctrines. The inability of making meaningful statemets about the universe around lies outside existential experiments and competence of human judgments. We cannot produce non-verbal or phenomenological data to give a meaning to our perceptions. This rejection also parallels the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which in one form states that we can never measure the momentum and velocity of the same particle at the same time. Also Einstein's special relativity needs to be mentioned which states that we cannot measure the exact metric of one system because the relativity of various inertial systems. The concept also parallels the Ames demonstrations in perception psychology, which showed that actually we do not perceive reality but receive signals from the environment which we organize into guesses so fast that we don't even observe ourselves guessing. The Gödel's incompleteness theorem also states that we cannot give a certain answers to a certain questions by definition. </p><p>We cannot find one "_deep reality_" that explains all other relative realities measured by our instruments -- and by our nervous system, the instrument that interprets all other instruments -- doesn't mean the same as the statement that there's no deep reality at all. What the instruments and brains actually tell us consists of relative perseptions of the same measurement or cross-sections of realities. The very notion that one deep reality can be found underlying all these relative instrumental/neurological realities rests upon certain axioms about the universe and human mind itself, which seemed obvious to our ancestors, but now seem either fratly untrue or rather pointless. Aristotelian logic assumes axiom of choice which states that there're only two classes of truthness: "_true_" and "_false_", post-Copenhagenist science tends to assume four classes, altough only Dr.Anatole Rapoport has stated the matter this clearly - "_true_", "_false_", "_indeterminate_", and "_meaningless_". Some logical positivists also refer to "_meaningless_" statemets as an abuse of language. Korzybski described them as "_noises_". </p><p>Among the propositions about the metauniverse which underlie the one deep reality fallacy, one can mention the concept of the universe as a static object, where current research seems to indicate that conceiving it as an active process fits the data better. A static thing or block-like entity can have one deep reality but a process has changing trajectories, evolution. It also implies the ide of the universe as a two-decker affair made up of "appearances and one underlying reality. Modern research indicates an indefinite series of appearances on diferent levels of instrumental magnification and finds no one substance or reality that underlies all the different appearances reported by different classes of instruments. So it seems, to this view, as absurd as one correct instrument, or the medieval one true religion and preferring, say, the wave model of matter to the particle model seems at least silly at first glance.</p><p>So, the physical truth does not possess more indwelling deepness rather than the chemical truth, or biological/psychiatric truth, and that all these emic realities have uses in their own fields, but we open the possibility that existential truth or phenomenological truth have as much depth as any other organized scientific ones. Doesn't the reality of schizophrenia or art remain real to those in schizophrenic or artistic states, however senseless these states appear to the non-schizophrenic or non-artistic? The very concept of isness has no meaning by definition and even the concept of E-Prime was proposed to remedy this. Nonetheless, it seems that, because the meaninglessness of all "_isness_" statemets hasn't been generally recognized, many physicists confuse themselves and their readers by stating "_There's no deep reality_". To be clear: human creates his own model of reality, or own reality-tunnel, or own gloss of the realities he encounters. Each of these formulations refer to definite and specific experiences in space-time, which easily confirm themselves in both daily-life demonstration and in controlled laboratory experiments on perception.</p><h3 class="sub">Noogenesis</h3><p>Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter).

His design was bold, radical, hence the radicalism of his transcendental reduction -- all possible worlds given to consciousness, regardless of their ontological status, should be "got rid of" so that the consciousness with its meanings and essences would be left alone with itself in its purity and absoluteness. Let us turn to Husserl's texts on time. One of the key works in this respect is the recently translated and published "Phenomenology of the Internal Consciousness of Time". Husserl himself, as we shall see, constantly turned to theme of perception of sound, tone and melody for the description of temporal structures of consciousness. Let us turn to Husserl's basic analytical distinction between "noesis-noema" and his micro-intrinsic analyzes of "tone". </p><div class="quote">It is obvious that the perception of a temporal object itself has a temporality, that the perception of the duration itself presupposes a duration of perception that the perception of any temporal form (Zeitgestalt) itself has its time form</div><p>This is the fundamental difference for Husserl between the duration of perception (or, if we take the active aspect - of constitutions) and the duration of the perceived (or constitutive) form -- there's a difference between noesis and noema within the Husserlian approach. Noesis is a constant field of consciousness, which always exfoliates from any conscious object. And the very concept of consciousness can, paradoxically, be considered within two moduses: conscious as object -- noema; conscious as subject -- noesis. Husserl in his description of the phenomenon of time constantly comes to the problem of the immanent perception of the tone (that is, already grasped in consciousness, the question of the "real" being of the tone is taken out of brackets) and the problem of the difference between tone as a noema and its consciousness, perception, and constitution as noesis. The tone as immanent property to the consciousness of an object is always given, as it were, against the background of the stream of its perceiving consciousness that holds the tone in its presence. </p><div class="quote">It (this tone) and duration, which it fills, are realized in continuity ... in a constant stream; and at a certain point, a certain phase of this stream is called "the consciousness of the beginning tone" and inside of the first timestamp of duration is realized inside the modus Now.</div><p>There's one of Husserl's central mental operations that turn simple human thinking into phenomenological, transcendental one. This is one of the most fascinating moments in Husserl's method for phenomenologists interested in -- the idea of ​​a multileveled phenomenological reduction. One of the basic procedures for philosophizing Husserl's procedures is a transcendental and eidetic reduction, thanks to which Husserl gets access to the primary structures of consciousness. Transcendental reduction is carried out by Husserl in order to exclude all that prevents consciousness from remaining alone with itself, in its adequate givenness, in pure self-reflection. </p><div class="quote">In this self-reflecting act, a givenness, consistent with consciousness, coincides with the true character of being</div><p>Husserl does not stop at this level of transcendental reduction and offers the next step, which turns the phenomenologist's mind toward the study of the phenomenon of essence. This step is an eidetic reduction. In fact, for Husserl, who in his criticism of psychology has abandoned the classical scientific path, phenomenology appears as science about eidos, about essences, not facts. The acquisition of essence in speculation is inseparable from the specific "technique" of variation of phenomena. The Husserlian path to the definition of essence is accomplished as a process of eidetic variation. Thanks to this process, the process of "turning" the phenomenon in the transcendental space, Husserl aspires to reveal that "through various variations remains unchanged, respectively, as a universal structure".</p><p>So to mention, it is generally accepted to perceive the human mind as the highest level of manifestation of consciousness that can arise as a result of the evolutionary development of nature. According to Integral Yoga, the mind isn't the final point of the development of consciousness. There're plans for consciousness to come above and below the human level -- these are the supramental and submental plans. However, the human mind has no contact with them and can not cover all possible ranges of consciousness, just like human vision can not perceive the entire range of electromagnetic radiation. The subsequent evolution of man consists precisely in becoming a conscious being at all levels and planes of existence. The realization of this evolution is the main goal of Sri Aurobindo's yoga.</p><h3 class="sub">Addendum</h3><p>All those thoughts are essentially the processing and preservation of information obtained through neuroreceptors -- visual, auditory, olfactory, et cetera. That is, in fact, a person is a biorobot, and all his behavior is a set of complex reflexes. Thoughts are just the information passed through the feedback principle, received in a receptive way. The idea of noosphere is easily refuted by mrt-scanning or by the same isotope positioning. Local excitation in the cognitive zone of the cortex precedes the so-called feeling of the emergence of a thought. And then the one who knows neurology, neurobiology, physiology (including the theory of functional systems) even at a basic level, shall understand how it came about and whence all of it came. This might seem like a desperate rejections of the described above, but should we actually penetrate this topic? The human inability to even understand a little bit of trivial concepts of "their" transcendence leaves us nothing more than hyperstitions. </p><p>Whitehead's metaphysics incorporated a scientific worldview similar to Einstein’s theory of relativity into the development of his philosophical system. His process philosophy argues that the fundamental elements of the universe are "occasions of experience," which can together create something as complex as a human being. This experience is not consciousness; there is no mind-body duality under this system, since mind is seen as a particularly developed kind of experience. Whitehead was not a subjective idealist, and while his occasions of experience (or "actual occasions") resemble Leibniz's monads, they are described as constitutively interrelated. He embraced panentheism, with God encompassing all occasions of experience and yet still transcending them. Whitehead believed that these occasions of experience are the smallest element in the universe—even smaller than subatomic particles.</p><p>Faith.</p><p>Through some twist of fate, western society has come to regard dogmatic faith as a virtue. To hold an idea as true despite all evidence to the contrary is an abdication of reason. Convictions are the end of knowledge, not the beginning; they are the enemy of truth more than lies.</p><p>In occasion to beauty it is worth noting one but -- all these concepts and postulates of beauty have common details, traced chronologically. By the way, these most common details were assigned to archetypes. And the archetypes themselves are a phenomenon of an exclusively evolutionary nature that has been formed and supplemented by millennia since the emergence of a reasonable person as a species. Over time, the patterns were supplemented and modified due to memetics. And in the end we came to what we have now. Faith is a key element in the consolidation of an idea in the collective unconscious. Faith is the principle of accepting an idea. This explains the belief in irrational ideas, such as belief in spirits and gods. It doesn't always depend on verification. Yes, verification plays an important role, but not in this case. To begin with, there must be a clear definition. If there is no such definition, then this something will be an idea. If there is, then an event. If this event implies a high degree of freedom, then this is a process, if it is low, then it is an object (or subject). Isn't everything can defined? The fact is that not everything actually can. If something can't be defined, then this is an idea. The idea of ​​something doesn't require a definition. Yes, it can mean endowing with properties for the sake of simplification. But at the same time there must be no clear definition.</p><p>Does the work of the device result from the interaction of its elements, or is the interaction of these elements is a consequence of its work? The topic can be disclosed due to its meaninglessness. The very fact is that with this approach a completely meaningful term "_consciousness_" is endowed with abstractness inherent in every esoteric, mythological abstractions and begins to slowly lose it, turning into a pointless idea. The term "_subconsciousness_" was defamed, so the term "_unconsciousness_" has more precise and correct idea of what's going on (which isn't likely).</p><p>Creation is always a transformation. And the creation of absolutely everything. Even creating particles from "_nothing_" is a converting from its raw materials (as it turned out from the so-called virtual particles -- again created by applying virtual energy to virtual particles). The same, by the way, concerns the energy itself. It is not created, it is transformed and always with losses due to entropy. Consciousness is a term that originally arose within the framework of philosophy at first, and then migrated to psychology and to a more accurate normal physiology. The term "_consciousness_" from the standpoint of philosophy or the same psychology does not make much sense in the absence of specifics. However, from the point of view of physiology this very term suddenly sharply begins to make sense. And the meaning itself - is a process, some kind of state. It refers only to the working elements -- the structural and functional units of the central nervous system. </p><p>The very knowledge has its own logical limit because a person is by itself an object with a small degree of freedom, while most quantum processes for instance, imply a greater degree of freedom. At the moment, the whole foundation can fit in this picture. It's unlikely that there'll be something new and qualitatively different. This's what commemorates our limitations as physical objects.  Everything nontrivially comes to quantum mechanics, the calculations of which are based in the majority on statistical probabilities. However, the whole problem of quantum computing boils down to trivial decoherence. Properties of the microworld with higher degrees of freedom will fade in the noisy macrocosm and extremely low degrees of freedom. Any observation leads to collapsing the quantum-entangled system. And in the macrocosm, all concepts of the quantum world simply don't work. That's why the direct influence of the quantum system on the macroobject is very insignificant. The universe itself doesn't develop -- it radiates and disintegrates rapidly. As is known, the universe tends to decay through planned radiation. Sooner or later the temperature insie the whole will be minimal and leveled across the whole. And in such a system the level of entropy will be infinitely high. Consequently anything won't be able to happen. The metaphysical fear will lose its meaning as well as other concepts entirely. Consequently time will lose its physical sense. This will mark the end of everyhting. The endless abyss we all that diligently come to even without any understanding of true metaphysical fear which awaits us from beyond.</p><p>So, unconscious can be both personal and collective. Collective unconscious is a prerequisite for the formation of identical reactions and behavioral forms. In the open collective unconscious is observed in social interactions, ethics. All artistic images created by man have references to the collective unconscious. Those can be described in terms of archetypes. We're the sets of archetypes, inherited and evolving since the very birth of homo sapiens as species. All our creations shall've references to that very archaic one that appeared long before us. And the only thing that we can leave behind is an imprint in collective unconscious. Even if we aren't alive, our ideas will live in the collective unconscious to the very end. This is the brain itself. </p><p>In the fortean century, the Scully type of people is typically called the "_pseudoskeptic_". This is a reactionary type, living to "_debunk_" anything that runs counter to his or her existing model of reality. The debunking, upon close inspection, loses its thin pretense of rationality and is exposed as a simple mammalian response to threat. In the case of the pseudoskeptic, the threat is typically conflict with whatever they learned in high school science class, and it highly resembles the response of a religious fanatic when dogma is directly conflicted.</p><p>In general, this might make you guess that this metaprose is just some sort of apport. On the other hand it could be attributed to hygroscopicity. I hope that this'll go beyond a simple draft in the nearest future. </p><h3 class="sub">TODO </h3><p>К влюблённым в себя города относятся снисходительно. Всех тайн не показывают, но пригласить на танец могут, да и подарить цветок, брошенный на асфальт (насмешка и знак благосклонности одновременно) - запросто. Если городу ты нравишься, то он покажет тебе потрясающей красоты закат. Подбросит несколько небольших сюрпризов, красивых и забавных, или сбивающих с толку. Наведёт на маленькое уютное кафе - но в следующий раз ты его не найдёшь.</p><p>Город любит играть с теми, кто младше него. Не по возрасту, конечно: по тому, насколько человек успел вырасти сам для себя.</p><p>Чаще всего с влюблёнными разговаривает ветер. Он посыльный от городов. Передаёт послания, наблюдает. Люди бывают от городов без ума, во всех смыслах: кого-то надо оберегать, а кого-то приводить в чувство.</p><p>Города влюблённых никогда не разочаровывают. Только терпеливо ждут, когда человек будет готов сменить своё наивное очарование на крепкую и хорошую дружбу.</p><p>Линии есть не только в метро. На площадях и улицах тоже можно отследить собственные тропинки: вот по такому маршруту через весь город тянется линия особенно зелёной и густой травы, на этой линии улиц слишком много света, а если идти вдоль другой - тебя всю дорогу будут встречать зеркала.</p><p>Обычно довольно сложно пройти такую линию от начала и до конца: они не столь очевидны, как простые дороги, а тянуться могут довольно долго. Зато если научишься в них ориентироваться - сможешь находить в городе любое место, какое только захочешь.</p><p>Редкие существа способны прокладывать эти линии или изменять их маршруты. Как правило, они из тех, что становятся надзирателями и вмешиваются в реальность только в самых крайних случаях. Чаще же их создаёт сам город.</p><p>Однако можно проложить временные линии: они будут, как нарисованная мелом тропинка по сравнению с настоящей дорогой, но всё же рабочими. Это под силу почти каждому, иногда достаточно просто замечать нужные знаки на своём маршруте или пройти его весь с первыми лучами рассвета, пока ещё ни один человек не ступил на эти улицы.</p><p>Есть слепые дома. Это те, что с чёрными провалами вместо окон, пустые, безмолвные.</p><p>Слепые дома - вещие. Они видят то, что было, и то, что может быть.</p><p>Только дома, которые имеют окна, способны видеть настоящее.</p><p>В слепых домах часто располагаются дыры в измерениях. Так же, как проваливаются в пустой оконный проем, легко провалиться в соседний, а то и весьма далекий, мир. Будьте осторожны, заходя в подобные места, всегда берите с собой снаряжение первой необходимости, оружие и хотя бы немного еды.</p><h3 class="sub">References </h3><a href="http://www.john-dee.org/Tertius.pdf">John Dee, Mysteriorum, Liber Tertius</a><a href="http://www.alzhup.com/Reta/Docs/ArtOfMemory.pdf">Giordano Bruno, Ars Memoriae</a><a href="http://www.literature.at/viewer.alo?viewmode=overview&amp;objid=11936&amp;page=">Johannes Trithemius, Liber octo quaestionum ad Maximilianum Caesarem de fide et intellectu</a><a href="http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pyrih/e/e2001v1/c/ect/node97.html">Indecomposable continuum</a><a href="https://www.academia.edu/1248055/Carl_G._Jung_s_Synchronicity_and_Quantum_Entanglement_Schrodinger_s_Cat_Wanders_Between_Chromosomes">C.G.
