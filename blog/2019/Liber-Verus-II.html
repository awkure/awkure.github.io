Whichever words I write, will mean less than desired. Linguistic relativism is the fundamental stepping stone in self destruction of potentiality I pointlessly trying to comperhend using those words I'm bounded with. Eventually what I choose to write won't be saying much about anything, but why I choose to write shall say much more in particular. It's the talk of meaning, the comperhension of realization. Even so I'm coherent with this being not as I'm willing for it to be. The Talos Principle states that in someone's life there has to be no purpose for living or otherwise there'll be nothing in existing. On the example of Jackson Pollack painting which he had drawn not just pure random strokes, but not on a sensefull mind but somewhere in between he made them just for the sake of existence. What would have happened in reversed direction? What would have happened whether he draws exactly what he supposed to draw, like "I can't draw anything unless I know exactly what I do" what would have happened? He'll never made a single mark. Hope the reader comperhends the losing fight that I've put up. Maybe this can be interpreted as creative automatism and its intention to interlope consciousness and reality through their shortest connecting line. </p><div class="quote">One creates philosophy only to be ruled by it</div><p>Nowadays, we are living inside of enclosed information terrarium. The bubbles of filters smoothly immerse the consciousness into its twilight state, wrapping it with comfortable and "usable" interfaces. These interfaces are designed by specialists each of whom, no doubt, has invested all of his entire lifetime, his soul in mastering his duties, in each particular concept, presumption, lemma. And all so that the person's reading will quickly enter an addictive state, lose the boundary between his own thought and act within the given interface. This thesis aims to provide another possible usable interface of formalising some aspects of consciousness based on the current models of homotopy/homology theories and presheaf stacks. In man's cognition of the world one of the most important aspects is questioning limits of human consciousness that cannot be ommited in questioning of the existence of such. The limitations of the cognitive means of the past such as repressive archaicity didn't allow rigorous scientific cognition to develop properly, but as it developed, science increasingly confidently invaded areas that previously were allowed only for philosophical research. The cosmological teachings could be provided as an instance of such. Every aspect in developing models that propose its own of how foundations of should be given, all of them in any way lead to our model of perception and cognition.</p><p>Human mind is unique and is not shared with other mammals. It's intersubjectively inseparable and uniform for every subject respectively, but within the concept of reification, human mind allows to subjectivate some consistent attributes with others. Consciousness is continuous unreversible ultra-complex multi-dimensional system of filtration of mind stream. Ancient chinese concept "Wu wei" describes consciousness and unconsciousness as being in interrelation within each other (they are both influencing each other, so theoretically isomorphism can be constructed upon it). The approach of formalising human consciousness has a deep ontological basis of unification of its ultra-complex structure meta-levels. It will be described later that due to multiple nature of perceived messages (each of which has its specific level of density on individual due to which with sound exploitation can produce human buffer overflow which forces the subject to perceive only the information given by the intruder) and quantum nature of prescribtions, it's confident to state that LEM in generalized (∞-1)-chronoidal-biotopos of the given model is not present and consists of multivalued non-commutative Quinn logic which lifts the concept of spatial-temporal geometry that also allows to define intuition, relations between emotions and topological nature of the ability of adaptation through natural selection. Self-awareness and the origin of symbolism allows the human brain to get rid of all Russel paradoxes, representing not only itself as a multi-dimensional meta-system with countably many horizons, but also as an ontological meta level of being, quiddity. It's also important to differentiate psychological states $\psi$ from structures $\phi$ and cognitive modes (CMs active or receptive/meditative). </p><div class="quote">When your realize that continuity and coherence are only constructs of the observer's mind it broadly liberates your range of expression</div><p>Thinking as gluing and bonding (Kurtov proposes the term of composition of selectors of the general flow of perception), covering, repetition, replication of fractals, erasing the distance. When connected, an energy arises that draws into itself. At the moment, the path of purification that leads to metaphysical orgasm. In its essential this is an examination of abstruse layers of consciousness and its non-physical experiencing. One who at least once saw dreams is familiar of such experience, whether one doesn't need body to participate in such process, living a different life detached from physical form of being, but nevertheless, remembering such sophistications. </p><p>Through evolutional development, human consciousness was strongly re-enforced and developed through repeated consensual social interactions. In the beginning such patterns were primitive and have involved rituals danced whose repetitive motions and sensory perception acts that have enforced the existence of self-aware state of being in Homo's minds. In theory this have also contributed into faciliating of emergence of human speech. Clearly a positive feedback and feedforward mechanisms were required and involved in development of human consciousness. It might be considered as one of solutions of hard problems of consciousness: How can one fully comperhend the emergence of non-spatial forms arising from one that is spatial within subjective manifold of human sensibility?  There have been attempts to link the brain's neu obiology with consciousness in order to explain the existence of qualia. In this thesis we shall adhere the Buddhist-philosophical monistic context of awareness but not consider it as principal. Surprisingly though, Husserl's reductionism shares such principle but comes from other, physical extreme. One may consider society as a second order complex meta-level of the human mind as its first order meta-level. : This process is iterated toward omega point of human evolution. God Omega, the whole united neural network of human mind. The overall effect of emergence of the unique, ultracomplex meta-level of consciousness and co-evolution due to co-existence since the times of tribal societies has been complete dominance over all other species on earth. This process can also be iterated to higher meta-levels that the emergence of the highly complex society of modern man is also resulting in the eventual, complete dominance of man as an individual. It's concluded that society leaves large amounts of its contributions in development of human consciousness indeed making it senseful of being the main clause of its emergence since we are as living organisms are tended to confront fundamental laws of the universe enclosed in the unstoppable process of entropysation, ascending to the state of maximal distraction by unifying which nowadays has a plethora of evidences of success of us ascending to the highest point of unifying with the one God Omega. Is it the biological limitations of the human brain are preventing by not being able to filter out all streams provided for analyzing the outside, filtering out most of the complexification pressed onto man by supra-complex modern societies? Has human brain already changed since the beginning of the industrial revolution? There are indicators of human consciousness of resisting — in spite of societal reification — changes imposed from the outside, perhaps as a result of self-preservation of the self which is also an argument in favor that history acceleration is most dense nowadays than it was even before. </p><div class="quote">The problems of today cannot be solved by the same level of intelligence that created them</div><p>In process of formalising human consciousness it's necessary to reject axiom of choice due to multiple nature, bistability and multistability of provided information from the outside that can be instantiated in optical illusions. From ancient times and even as for now one of the most fundamental problems that are present is psychophysical problem — the problem of the nature of human cognition, subjective sensations, thinking and free will based on the laws of world's cognition. Consciousness by its essence is the most difficult to research phenomenon. At the present level of knowledge we cannot state the existence of consciousness in other people, although we intuitively tend to consider this as obvious. There will be also described the problem of the existence of consiousness in persons suffering from certain mental disorders as well as the existence of consiousness in children of a very young age such as infants and even animals. Curious reader might even consider the connection between the possible solution of psychophysical problem with religious method of questioning such as existence of God, life after death and the very consistency of particular religion. This problem is also highly discussed not only in philosophical doctrines since Democritus, but also in todays neurobiology and medicine. It would be great if somehow humanity will find a way of making snapshots of one's consciousness so that most of the mental disorders can actually be healed not just by decomposing particular parts of brain so that dissentients turn into houseplants. Idealistic theories of consciousness (that are supported throughout this thesis but only some of their aspects) state that subjective phenomena are born and observed independently the material structure of one's organism and therefore cannot be objectively registered by any means other than by indirect evidence. Some psychophysical models claim that the existence of the sphere of the subjective doesn't affect the state of material world and can be then described under assumption of its absence. Subjective phenomena aren't idepndent between each other, they all have some particular correlations, one perception can be predicted from the other with help of volitional acts. We will also discuss the multiple nature of subjective phenomena that are describing the same material object. In process of cognition, the observer forms the apprehension that there exist multiple consciousness such as solipsistic point of view doesn't hold. Because of it, matter is endowed with an additional structure such that materialistic fact cannot be expressed using only one's perception of it, but in a sum of perceptions of all subjects that observe the given object. The truth or falsity of a statement about matter can be tested by various subjects of consciousness with same result. However even if consciousness is unique, further reasoning retains its meaning. </p><p> (move) There's a mental mechanic that doesn't require any intellect and which in the absence of any required filter brings to disturbance of consciousness. A plasticine, which is drawn from somewhere in unlimited amounts from which can be constructed potential virtual (or even actual) worlds. If you treat metatext well enough you can drown in this world, without any guarantee to come back. There will drawn beautiful mystical evrestical paintings all of which will cohere with specific gematria but it is no more than just a mere toying. The true honesty required to go further. </p><div class="quote">The emergence is thought of as a formation, an introduction of a form from the beyond, thus existence is thought of as the result of the action of an active form on a passive substrate. The form is the structuring model, the carrier of the structural image named eidos.</div><p>Attempting mathematicians in spite of craving the foundations of mathematics and the logical foundation of theory of the mind propose an enormous plethora of theoretical models that also will partly be discussed here. Cantor gave the following definition: "a set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception — Anschauung". As stated by one of its conceivers, set theory might be considered as a cognitive science. Whitehead proposed a cognitive conception of mathematics, developing at length a theory of perception in which any entity of the universe has a model of perception entwinted within it, considering events as elementary constituents in place of masses. </p><div class="quote">There's urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for world around us. </div><p>Frege also proposed a fully linguistic and cognitive interpretation of logic. In cognition, it gave birth to the whole field of analytical philosophy of human consciousness and its interconnectedness with language. Every aspect in developing models that propose its own model of how foundations of a should be given, all of them in any way lead to our model of perception and cognition. At the beginning, Hilbert formulated his work on arithmetization of mathematic by encoding it theretofore, such that any theorem could be synthetically derived, stating the isomorphism between mind and calculus. Godel promptly discovered the theorems of incompleteness, creating the obstruction of Hilbert's program on the basis of ZFC axioms using the arithmetical encodings of such. His thesis inspired Turing in developing computational classes on cognitive reasoning principles. Such an equivalence can be legitimated using the following reasoning inspired by Penrose in which the following inclusion sequence is justified: cognition $\subset$ physics $\subset$ mathematics. This sequence can be largely discussed as well in a reverse order on which Mathematics and Physics can be considered only as subsets of human consciousness described as a way of our current modelling of the outside world.</p><p>Nowadays set theory is no longer considered as a sufficient foundation for mathematics being replaced by so popular category theory which greatly solves paradoxes such as self-referentiation. (M)</p><div class="quote">As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.</div><h3 class="sub">Emptiness (M)</h3><p>The ontology of things in unity is the integrity of it basis, which defines its substance. Non-existence of thing is an effect of destructuring this basis. It's highly important to differentiate emptiness and non-existence. Non-existence of a separate area of physical reality describes the abscence of any density compacted inside and the very space itself. One might argue that the unending abyss beyond our universe is an instance of such, but this's a complicated method of questioning that might not posses an actual truth and will be probably discussed later on. So, the absense of density and space entails the absence of time and therefore the absence of any movement and interaction which contradicts Hegel's and Aristoteles fundamental laws of reality. </p><p> (possible deletion) Giving the definition means to describe it in terms of another a universe of an upper level. Conscious is more broad concept than matter because it can be defined in terms of consciousness (described below). Due to inconsistency of the previous definitions it's necassary to conclude that even so consciousness isn't material and which cannot be defined in terms of objective reality and be both non-materialistic and be its property leads to definition of another reality, idealistic one. In materialistic point of view, matter can be adequatly described in assumption of the absence of something but itself and therefore — casually closed. The interaction of the conscious organism within the environment is carried out by biological reactions to stimuli and the process of information processing and decision making is subjectively experience by us as a sequence of images and volitional acts. </p><p>During the human history the concept of soul was separated from sensible things and consequently from material world. The consciousness is not matter but highly entwinded within it in a fractal chaotic matter which will be described below. Consequently because consciousness is not matter, it's necessary for existing some substance that provides its fromation. This transphysical expanse is what we tended to call "soul" and even with the given framework the things will not get this easy to describe. Because of the soul, human is the only one accessible optical instrument by virtue of we are allowed to make an attempts in communicating with outer layers, with worlds, that are beautifully described in Dante's poem.</p><h3 class="sub"> Ontology</h3><p>Suppose that we have a collection $\Omega : \Re_1$ of elementary events and $F$ its power set, the elements of which called possibilities. We can encode this set by attaching to every element of $\Re_\omega$ its probability of occuring namely we have a map $E : \Re_\omega \rightarrow \Re_\omega \times I$ such that $E \Omega = 1$ to obtain its representative mapping cyllinder. Consequently if $\mf{A}$ and $\mf{B}$ have no elements in common then we have distributivity law as well, namely $E (\mf{A}\lor\mf{B}) = E\mf{A} + E\mf{B}$ This also may be constructed further to a field of probability, sticking to a specific axioms consequently. We have a concept of conditional probability $E (\mf{B}/\mf{A}) = E (\mf{A}\land \mf{B})/E \mf{A}$ which means that the existence of event $\mf{B}$ is conditionally dependent on $\mf{A}$. This might lead to a point that probability and randomness are simply the definition of abstract geometric volume in space and addition. The usual opposition between common notions of determinism and non-determinism fails. The popular statement "God does not play dice" could be interpreted as "Geometry of space-time cone has no volume" which doesn't make much sense. One of the consequences of Kolmogorov's axioms is that it has direct geometrical representation, usually named the probability simplex.  (simplex definition — A simplex is defined as the set of families of the numbers $P\omega, \omega ∈ \Omega, \forall\omega, P\omega \in \mb{I}$. It parameterizes all probability laws on $\omega$). The theorem of total probability states that given a set of elementary events $\Omega = \bigcup \mf{A}$ we also have its set of possibilities namely $E X = \bigcup P\mf{A}$ as the set of barycentric coordinates of the probability $EX$ in (n-1)-dimensional simplex. One can also consider the possibility of constructing a subcomplex of these probability simplexes by an iterated process of exclusion of faces that describes the cancelation of probabilities. </p><p>Regarding on the previous definition of probability simplicies we can now describe the place of interconnectedness of consciousness and matter in the provided model.</p><p>Conscious (subjective reality) is one that is observed as a whole and doesn't contain time locality.</p><p>Matter (objective reality) is one that is observed partly and contains time locality. </p><p>There can exist many objective and subjective realities. Most of the sensations are entangled within the one basis objective reality with its general laws, metric space. There can be distinguished other hypothetical realities that satisfies the given definition of matter above (simulated via computer, literary and spiritual). </p><p>Observable fact $F\mf{A}$ in reality $\mf{A}$ is one from which the given reality depends at least at one point in time. If reality $\mf{A}$ is subjective then $F\mf{A}$ is subjectively observable and objectively observable otherwise. Exceptionally subjective fact (highest gnosis) is the one that is non-observable in no objective reality, exclusively objective fact is the one that is non-observable in no subjective reality respectively. The existence of exclusively subjective facts is the central question of psychophysical research. Exceptionally objective facts might not exist at all due to the existence of universal observer, hypercosmic god. </p><p>Whether all facts of reality $\mf{B}$ are observable in reality $\mf{A}$, therefore reality $\mf{B}$ is uniquely defined from reality $\mf{A}$. This statement is proved by contradiction. Suppose that all facts $\mf{B}$ are observable in $\mf{A}$ but inside an unique realization of reality $\mf{A}$ there could be more than one realization of reality $\mf{B}$ which leads to the fact that all facts specific to any of realization $\mf{B}$ are non-observable in $\mf{A}$. </p><p>If all facts of reality $\mf{B}$ are observable in reality $\mf{A}$, but not all facts of reality $\mf{A}$ are observable inside reality $\mf{B}$ therefore we have an inclusion $\mf{B} \subset \mf{A}$</p><p>If all subjective facts are objectively observable then matter monosemantically determines subjective reality.</p><p>It is proved straightforwardly. Assume the contradiction where the existing objective reality can be matched within two different (on some arbitrary fact) subjective realizations which means that facts which are specific to one of the realizations are exclusively subjective ones which contradicts the definition.</p><p>Materialistic correlate of subjective phenomena is an physical event containing all information about the given phenomena.</p><p>The univalence axiom holds — if we can construct an isomorphism between two realities $\mf{A}$ and $\mf{B}$ (all the facts of reality $\mf{B}$ are observable in reality $\mf{A}$ and otherwise) then they are equal. </p><p>Simulated realities such as ones in computer games directly depend on computer that simulates them which is observable in our basis reality, so simulated reality of computer game is included inside ours and cannot be considered independent. </p><h3 class="sub">Matter </h3><p>Which does matter. </p><p>One of the central places in ontology takes the problem of existence of matter. The surrounding matter isn't perceived directly, but due to constructed model of perceptions and senses. Abstracting from the surface of realization we push and swing towards its depths. We are counting and abstracting such spaces even beyond infinity, \omega, \omega^\omega. Lurking into the slits between seconds in order to pull something from there. The desired voluntary approach to death for the sake of awareness that "Myself" can at least feel something. Everything repeated is boring. Everything new is given under the current circumstances in the given environment and therefore cannot be desired. Only what is beyond which is located in the deepest sea of potentiality is desirable because of violation ineffable laws of nothingless. When one perceives an object he automatically tend to label it (nice, bad, hot, wet, et cetera). As soon as his mind puts a label on such object, the label takes the place of the actual object in his mental processes. Mental image can never represent all the different qualities and characteristics of any object and is always a simplified exaggerated subjective snap shot. Foot only feels itself when it touches the ground so this applies to consciousness also, it has its quiddity only within the boundaries of perceivable matter within observable universe. For what is beyond looses any intuition of self-awareness and even if one go to heaven, he will not even feel like it as his current state after his death. There's a branch of mathematics that tries to describe the topology of the beyond based on Cantor's set theory which also has a lot of its contrintuitive properties and what lies even further, beyond \omega^\omega one cannot even imagine because there one looses all intuition about every ordinary aspect known in mathematics today. </p><div class="quote">What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning (W.Heisenberg)</div><div class="quote">The history of the world is nothing other than the progress of the consciousness freedom (Hegel)</div><p>Due to marxism, consciousness is not identified with matter, but rather is a property of highly organized matter because of its dihotomy in existence and what might seem its independence from.

One might as well talk of the existence of Heaven without that of Earth, or of the negative principle without the positivem which is clearly impossible. Yet people keep on discussing it without stop; such people must be either fools or knaves. (莊周)</div><p>The problem of existence of matter (and all objective reality) is one of the central questions in philosophy and especially ontology. The concept of matter shall also be highly discussed from now on. The matter is felt not directly, but through the provided by nature sense organs, which projects the data. collected by them inside consciousness, so it's getting obvious that there's a huge difference between the subject (noema) and it's footprint inside one's mind. Throught early childhood the person learns how to differentiate multiply-passed images of the real world even though we are tended to postulate the existence of matter because we, as self-aware creatures highly depend on it. The problem of where do from a child recevies intuition about those ambiguous concepts such as matter, time, space and principle of causality will be shortly discussed later on. </p><p>Here for the basis will be taken empirical (sensual) position in definition of matter that the only singular reality is a subjective experience, based on which it can be judged whether it's pointful to discuss such a topic. Firstly there will be discussed the definition of matter from empirical-solipsistic point of view, who doesn't have any representation imprinted in subject's consciousness as well as confirmation of the existence of other sensual observers. Something similar might be observed in infants, but the process of cognition goes on subconsciousness level though they cannot provide a proper reflexy for the process itself. Some evident Foundamental Empirical Facts (such as existence of the observer itself) will be axiomatized from later on in terms not digress from the original view of this thesis. </p><p>1. The existence of the phenomena is specific only to "myself" even though by now there is no distinction between "myself" and "others".</p><p>2. The existence of "my" consciousness and subjective reality directly depends on "my" subjective phenomena</p><p>Consciousness may be divided on a separate groups of subjective phenomena — images and volitional acts. Images are subjective perceptios such as pain, hearing and vision, emotions that are derivatives of fear (laught as the abscence of fear, sadness, denial, anger, bargain, depression as it's first derivative, love as fear of not fulfilling the biological responsibilities, from behavioristic point of view our social evolution and the principle of natural selection are all based on the most fundamental emotions of all. But fear is only a misunderstanding of what might have happened to us after crossing the sacred horizon, the point of maximum distraction) and consciousness images of past. Volitional acts on the contrary are kind of mental instructions such as manipulating body parts and conscious process with aim to change the current state of consciousness which might be directly confused with inner voice. Even without an actual representation of the body inside one's mind, empirical solipsist can diffirentiate volitional acts and images because there's fundamental boundary between subjective phenomena and an actual act. For instance, there can be brought phantom pains of ones that lost their limbs. </p><p>Images differ by their reflexive (quantitative) and qualitative characteristics. This difference is considered as one of the hard problems of consciousness. From mind-body dualism to synthetic monadic view. We can construct a poset of images that differ by quantitative characteristics. If one hears 2 same sounds differed only by their loudness than we can (but not always) differ them which corresponds to some subjective quantity. Reflexie consciousness is being conscious of its own "states of the mind" which can be formalised due the proper feedback for instance via neural networks. Otherwise these sounds differ in qualitative characteristic. For instance one cannot pick a picture from a bunch that differ just in color palette without regarding to personal preferences and cannot rationalize properly his choice. Colors act as qualitative characteristics of an image (simply qualia). A scientist, Mary, is living in a black and white room with books providing her all the "reflexive" knowledge about color, including its physical, artistic and neuroscientific aspects. Qualia is what Mary experiences when she first appears to be more like a linguistic relativistic human problem, identifying high level cognitive linguistic abstraction with elementary color perception. We can only assume that Mary would gain a new qualitative experience by seeing color, which would be in full agreement with her abstract qualitative, linguistic experience of color. Monistic point of view reconsciles qualia and quantitas in one monadic unity of consciousness aspects. </p><p>For all subjective phenomena there is also a structuring subjective value named time which helps to compare all subjective phenomena by their time intervals. The current state of consciousness described by all subjective phenomena with the same subjective time continuum since we cannot state subjectively whether phenomena occures "right now". You are half of a yactosecond away from "now".</p><p> Husserl phenomenological epoché is stated in the rejecting of all preliminary knowledge and assumptions about the world and is a methodical step towards substantiating the significance of reality as a correlate of the subjectivity of consciousness.</p><p>The second fundamental empirical principle comes out from axiological inequality of images which leads to existing of demands. Subject differs images by their gratidues of demand. The third fundamental empirical principle comes from the fact that observer cognizes consistent patterns which associate subjective phenomena. </p><p>(M) Indra net </p><p>Connections between images and volitional acts are present due to causality principle. Volitional acts are means of influencing on images. We can construct an isomorphism between images and volitional acts. One way $VA \rightarrow \Im$ the observer influences on the image by some specific volitional act. From $\Im \rightarrow VA$ the observer makes a conclusion or decision making on the provided information about the object. Consequently due to realization of the observer of his power of changing images from his volitional acts, he starts to do this with aim to satisfy his demands. Same volitional acts lead to same concrete representation of perception. The map therefore is continuous. </p><p>Current representation depends not only on previous chain of volitional acts, but also on previous representations as well. If you set a point in space and then move your head away where it's nowhere to be seen, then the previous sentence appears to be trivial. Mentioning this chain of previous representations may be as long as the universe age itself ( : Laplace's Demon), causing butterfly effects for the next ones due to universe determinism, but it isn't taken as an axiom in present model. The major point is that not all things in the universe can be realized from the previous states of consciousness. The current state of coinductive mindstream in this model will be defined as a triple $\langle PS,VA,DF\rangle$ where </p><p>$PS$ — past conscious states and observation of current state of representations. </p><p>$VA$ — volitional act. </p><p>$DF$ — desired future. </p><p>System A has its local time whether in any 3 states ($\mc{A}_1$ at $t_1$) ($\mc{A}_2$ at $t_2$) and ($\mc{A}_3$ at $t_3$) where $t_1 < t_2 < t_3$, state $\mc{A}_1$ does not contain any additional information about state $\mc{A}_3$ which might not be in $\mc{A}_2$. So the closer any two states in time, the more complete information has one state present on another. So Laplace determinism is a special case of this fundamental empirical fact where every state contains complete information on any other independently from time. Consciousness is not determined by itself as well as it is not a volitional act. To get rid of time locality we have to consider an additional set of phenomena which are not subjective by themselves but causally related with them which helps to foresee the next states of consciousness without its full prehistory. Note that the definition of time-local system is weak enough to state that its subsystems might be non-local due its perturbation and butterfly effect. Non-locality of consciousness can be described in terms of that the consciousness by itself is a part of a bigger system and somehow interacts with its environment — matter. This theoretical reality cannot be experienced fully, but definded mostly theoretically within all its properties that are verified due to matching within data obtained from empricial experience. Physical reality might be considered as an instance of the previous definition of matter. It's an analytical continuation of consciousness which happen to have analogous properties -- it depends on time, characterised on quantitative values which are called physical ones, can be graduated. </p><p>Thus we have the following</p><p>1. Matter casually entangled with consciousness or otherwise it is non-local and non-observable.</p><p>2. Matter consists of independend from consciousness gratitude of freedom or otherwise it will have the same volitional acts.</p><p>Therefore</p><p>1. Subjectively observed fact is one from which at least at one moment in time depends the state of consciousness of the observer. </p><p>2. Objectively observed fact is one from which at least at one moment in time depends the state of matter.</p><p>There exists subjectively observed objective facts and objectively observed subjective ones. The first one is that it can be judged from senses. And the other can be instantiated from another observer's report on some matter analysis, his immanent state of being and thoughts. Subjective idealism means that there can be subjectively non-observable objective facts which means that the very concept of matter is insignificant since all needed information is already contained in consciousness. So we can conclude that the essence of matter must be observed only partly and the observer cannot be provided with its full representation.  : RM quote on subject analysis </p><p>Thus we have</p><p>1. The matter partly defines the picture of its representations.</p><p>2. The matter depends on volitional acts.</p><p>We can construct a functor $\psi : C_{Qn} \rightarrow M_{Qn}$ from quantitative characteristics of senses to quantitative characteristics of matter. $M_{Qn}$ can depend with $C_{Qn}$ directly and indirectly. For example direct dependence can be seen in senses (bright - dark, hot - cold, loud - quiet). Indirect are those that perceived from direct ones (any measurment and calculation). The set of indirectly observable facts is defined from state of matter and depends on volitional acts. Consequently, observer recognises matter not only because his senses, but also due to volitional acts which helps to make conclusions on before unseen $M_{Qn}$. </p><p>Due to interconnectedness, the laws of physics are then possible to exist. Consequently, any material characteristic can be expressed in terms of any subjective quality. For instance to find out what temperature is outside you can go to the balcony and guess it by yourself, you can look at the thermometer or you can hear it from another person. </p><p>Cognition connections between consciousness and matter and connections inside this matter that allow to prescribe senses not directly within their memory envornment, remembering to which result due to the current state of consciousness might lead one or the other volitional act, but rather throught matter — we analyze the state of matter and predict its modifications using volitional acts to obtain the desired sensation which helps only partly eliminate time locality of consciousness. </p><p>Subjective time is defined on some limited precision. Special theory of relativity brings some ambiguity in definition of simultaneousness. Since space cannot be separated from time this leads to the problem of Minkowski's space-time cone locality (STL). Also due to nondeterminism of quantum mechanics (such problems as quantum teleportation/entanglement/non-locality/superposition) leads us to the point that we can think of matter approximately local (since those quantum occurences operate on microscopic level and might be considered as unimporent so far). In the representation of matter it one can fully get rid from time locality problem from sensations. Since earlier, their image was fully dependent from its full prehistory of states of consciousness, than now it can be depended from current state of matter which can be purposefully prepared in advance. So therefore we have an isomorphism between these two concepts. This gives a bigger advantage since information of previous states of consciousness does not preserve in memory wholly and matter can replace those probabilistic holes. Matter in terms of consciousness might be analogued as hidden variable in terms of quantum mechanics which is also measurable (unlike in QM due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). </p><p>To instantiate suppose that one puts an object in cellar somewhen, he opens the door and what will he see? To model such situation it's necessary to know the appearance of the door and an additional fact of this object being in a cellar, this fact is materialistic and separated from matter, so that this statement is impossible to express. In worst case scenario the subject was used to remember all previous states of all its images and make predictions. It's obvious that due to limitations of human brain the previous statement is empirically false, so that for remembering something more, the subject has to modify the state of matter (make a note, probe an unalyzed object) using the characteristic volitional acts. Therefore, the existence of matter within all its properties is another fundamental empirical fact for an observer. Formation of representations about matter gets rid of all solipsism and makes observer be aware of another conscious subjects. </p><p>There can be 4 ontological possibilities of correlation of the existence of exceptionally subjective and objective facts</p><p>$\langle ESF+, EOF+\rangle$ — They're ontologically separated and matches dualistic definition.</p><p>$\langle ESF+, EOF-\rangle$ — Idealistic point of view. Monistic whether one accepts the existence of universal observer, pluralistic otherwise.</p><p>$\langle ESF-, EOF+\rangle$ — Materialistic point of view. Monistic whether one accepts the existence of one universal base reality, pluralistic otherwise, whether one accepts multiple included realities. </p><p>$\langle ESF-, EOF-\rangle$ — Panpsychism, whether one accepts the entwinted correlation of subjective and objective reality, endowing the environment with spiritual characteristics. </p><p> The main question proposed in this thesis is whether consciousness may be considered as a separate entity within all its non-local characteristics such as idealism and dualism or rather considered as a proper part of matter (property of matter, function of matter, is generated by matter, et cetera). Due to the fact that outer world is analysed by senses, it is proposed to consider consciouss not as a matter by itself, but with some dualistic point of view. If one reduces the definition of consciousness to matter than this fact actually may help to expand the very definition of matter as a whole. Bergson at the time identified sensation of existence of matter within its existence. One uses the same methods of analyzing external matter which is observable only as a form of changing consciousness correlate due to external irritants.</p><p>Subjective phenomena doesn't exist separately from their materialistic correlates and therefore everything in psychophysical hypotheses are cognisible. Perceptions might be presented as immanent state of matter. Since consciousness can be contracted to matter then any subjective phenomenon as all matter is multiqualitative and intersubjective. Possibly there might exist a way to connect to another human brain and therefore sense all his subjective phenomena which helps to solve the problem of qualia (for example might be presented subjectivity of perceptions of color. One might percept red as you percept it as blue). If every subjective fact is objectively observable then the solution must exist objectively.</p><p>We have 2 definitions of solipsism</p><p>1. There is nothing more than "mine" consciousness in the universe.</p><p>2. There may exist only one subjective reality.</p><p>The first one denies the existence of matter and hence is denied due to empirical facts. The second one allows the existence of "my" subjective facts objectively in theoretical materialistic reality, constructed to express them. This allows to exist more than one consciousnesses. Since any practical activity boils down to achieving one or the other state of conscousness then materialism leads to the fact that from the interacting with matter we can achieve any consciousness state. </p><p>Even though human brain has lots yet finite number of neurons that enables one to construct abstract concepts of percepted things, apart from thing themselves, thus allowing for extension of representations to higher dimensions even though we are accustomed to only three, paradoxically extending the abilities of human consciousness far beyond the apparent, finite limitations of ultra-complex system of human brain. One may assume this concept as a net without boundary occuring and influencing the moving of consciousness hyperplane. It might be assumed that considering human brain as 'system' is not the right terminology since it possess no boundary but an open multiverse of many layers of processes of processes (∞-groupoid) with multiple horizons. The mind has thus freed itself of the real constraints of space-time cone by separating through virtual constructs the concept of time and space that are conquered by the illusion of human free will. To instantiate, among such constructs are emphasised — symbolism, concept of infinity, causality, evolution, universality, abstract mathematical relations in higher dimensions, many-valued logics. </p><p>Horizon as boundary of another, deviant, external dark dream that dosen't act on people. Or even, the boundary of the brightest light that burns consciousness from its roots. Careless peeking inside dreams as pleasently digging into nothingless about which one cannot say anything and which brings enormous amounts of pleasure by the very feeling of impossibility. Sacred intimacy, which may be seen as non-sinful because of the absence of possibility to violate prohibitions and the very absence of choice, volition or possibility. The insides of a horror. The co-emergence and co-evolution of the unique human mind and society, with the emergence of an ultra–complex level of reality can be understood in terms of the emergence of human consciousness through co-evolution/societal interactions and highly efficient communication through elaborate speech and symbols. Following a detailed analysis, the claim is defended here that the human mind is more like a ‘multiverse with a horizon, or horizons’ rather than merely a ‘super-complex system with a finite boundary’. To quote Gregory Bateson (who also supported the theory of inseparability of consciousness and matter) on what he insisted that in the world of mental processes the difference lies in the analog of cause, and then argues that embedded and and interacting systems have a capacity to select a pattern from apparently random elements, as it happens during the human evolution procedure. </p><p>You're locked with a screeching birdman without mouth in a very dark frightening place inside the rift of subjectivity and objectivity which highly resembles the cellar, that cellar that you were used to explore being in your preteens at your grandmas place. Now this cellar is more than just an empty vessel for you and your poor alter-ego, it doesn't have any prominent textures that your conscious could have cought onto. This nonending darkness shrouds you with a veil from the very inside of your body. You are trying to escape, but there is simply no exit, there's nowhere to run because of the endless possibility of nothing. Purgatory is one of its names. You might be dead or might be on the verge of being dead and alive at the same time but it doesn't matter at all. You see this man trying to exist within the undictated rules of this room. You're trying to hug him and he's trying to hug you in reply, but he has no hands. Smells like foul meat. "Who are you?" — your weak and frightened mouth is trying to ask. He noticed this pointless effort of changing something that is unchangable and with all this hatred he filled with, he began the transformation. His mouth opened that wide that is beyond of what his body allows like he's trying to turn his insides out, finally showing yourself what he had put all his life efforts till this very moment, the moment of realization.</p><div class="quote">The middle between any two poles is always the point of greatest stress. A rubber band, for instance, stretched on opposing sides will eventually snap in half. I mention this rudimentary fact because the rift is itself the mean between multiple universes and represents the meeting point between these zones. If the rift pertained to a normative set of rigid physical laws like our world it would easily break trying to accommodate the contradicting forces it channels.</div><h3 class="sub"> Perception </h3><p>As were stated eralier, once one perceives an object, the automatic labeling comes in. As soon as as his mind puts a label on that object, the label takes place of the actual object leading to oversimplified and usually exaggerated subjective representation inside one's consciousness. All our reflexion with outer world is prescribed by our representation of it and are conditioned by our senses.</p><div class="quote">What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning (W.Heisenberg)</div><p>Due to Bergson's theory of consciousness, perception is a noema, a filtered flow of the outside, not their direct representation, but a part that was successfully perceived. Representations are separated on actual (external world and matter) and virtual (habits and pure memory). </p><p>Define a cone of dynamic memory as follows — Its sections are different gratitudes of memory compression, the apex of which weakly balks onto the infinite plane of actual perceptions (those that can be fixed physically). At the base of the given cone is fixated past in all its smallest details (nebula of all memories in its entirety). At its peak lies maximal compression of memory, extreme attention to actual images (one can reconstruct the whole memory phenomena only because of the external stimulus that helps to remember). Therefore there are 2 common human types -- Ones that absentmindedly perceive actuality and ones that are focused on some actual objective. </p><p>Virtual images are mixed within actual ones. This principle is called double exposition. To instantiate, one looks at wall (actual perception) and remembers someone relative to subject, his face, which consequently and abstractly projects it onto the wall. </p><p>The apex of this cone is the moment of unification of memory and matter. Due to highest complexity of consciousness, principles such as double exposition, spontaneous remembrance leads to the fact that their unification holds fractal propinquity. Spontaneus memories are being studied in theory of psychical dynamics. Due to Freud, the theory of unconsciousness is not stable because it is described only in time and not space-time cone itself. This can be associated, for example, within two poles of Alexander horned sphere. Because of the fact, that to perceive and filter any object it always takes time than the perception appears only by previous states in time and therefore the mixture of actual and virtual hyperplanes is continuous. </p><p>Memory doesn't appear inside brain because the brain itself is a centre of filtration of all perceptions. For the residual memory inside brain, the brain itself must be this image of the external. Brain is not a substract of memory but only its interface for selection of certain snapshots. There'sn't decrease in memories, but decrease in access to memories. Such rejection of the flows may be generalised to any. Humanity nowadays is busy to maintain their narrowed reality. Collosal amounts of energy is invested in fortification of current conditions such as that was before in era of religional and cultural dominance. Extramundane and off-system is estimated as mockery and the imitation of controlled delusions, catastrophical breakdown. The person ceases to be perceived seriously and looses all its authority. Emanated information is no more perceived as knowledge of any form. Their clapans are being closed for accepting any external incoming information. Dismissal. He's no more than a houseplant. The majority of assumed solutions are satisfying but not optimal. As any other organism, human is tended to save his energy and hence any speculation comes throught the stoppage on a moment of minimally satisfying resolution. A person does not need to see more of its available spectrum. People prefer simple lies over complex truth.</p><p>Memory is a spirit, selector, expressed as a substitution of λ-term. Consciousness (as the matter itself) is functional, but unlike matter, is ultracomplex functional on all meta-levels. In some way actions in virtual world are being resonated with past and this representation of memory is connected within actual images and therefore subject becomes more adapted as biological species, so that's how selection appears between virtual images with their actual primacy. This interpretation of perception is a variation of activism — perception and psyche are dependend from holistic actual volitional act. Perception measures person's ability in action. Material world consists of images whose parts act and react on one another, producing motion. Actuality of perception consists in its activity, motions which continue it. It is important to emphasise a boundary between perception and remembrance. From perception its organic parts as memory are not distinguished. Perception is not a momentary act, but a complex lasting process. In studying matter and perception it's necessary to mention continuity volitional act and consciousness at which perception is united and synthesysed not only from perceptoins but all gamma of feelings. </p><div class="quote">To perceive consciously is to choose and conscousness consists above all in this practical destinction. Different perceptions of same object that are given by different senses shall not coincide and therefore cannot provide complete representation of the object — there will always be gaps between them, spacing in some way commensurate with the gaps in needs. The formation of feelings is necessary precise to fill these gaps. This development aims to harmonize senses and restore continuity between the given information and approximately restore the material object as a whole. </div><p>Memory is separated into two subkinds — mechanical and independent. Motor-mechanical processes are perceived due to the interaction with matter, but memory demonstrates its independence from matter. Canonical stereotypical mental disorders Bergson associates within violation of "mechanical" functions which are more likely habitual rather than the memory itself. Those subspecies are interconnected, for a memory to reappear in consciousness it is necessary that it is descended from the heighs of pure memory to the same strictly defined point where action takes place. Deleuze perceives the world in desires. Desires are indivisible and pristine substance. Act is a consequence of desire of its performance. </p><h3 class="sub">Epoché</h3><p>The phenomenological epoche is consistent due to rejection from all preliminary knowledge and assumptions about the perceived world and by itself is a methodical step towards substantiating the significance of reality as a correlate of intersubjectivity of human consciousness. Husserl describes epoché as the unity of phenomenological and eidetic reduction, abstracting from accidents and individual picularities of acts of thinking which directed toward finding the essential structures of intentional mental acts. There's also the concept of transcedental reduction which leads to the removal of empirically-bodily components of consciousness leaving the sphere of its pure substract. </p><h3 class="sub"> Language </h3><p>The main question proposed in this section is the describtion of mutual interconnectedness of the language and consciousness. The problem of interconnectedness of language, cognition and external world is widely discussed in many fields of cognitive science and philosophy. Some may guess that language provides naming of something that exists inside subjective reality and therefore this categorisation is predefined. Others may think that categorisation and conceptualisation may appear from their possibility, that any object may be classified in many various ways of same phenomena. This may also concern other species such as animals. They do have some metaphorical language on a primitie level (the instance with dolphins is slightly more complicated), but on the contrary with our language it might be considered insignificant (for the time being). The characteristic of an universal language framework such as Noam Homsky's generative grammars is also one of the main topics proposed in this section. This is exactly the main question of Sapir-Worf's relativistic linguistic hypothesis which states that language, if not determines then somehow influences on thought and decisions. This method is relativistic which means that cultural relativism might influence the methods of world perception. Thinking might be considered as a form of immanent speculation which is inborn or rather obtained during the familiarization with provided language. Others might consider thinking as experience and reasoning which were acquired independently from language. Also there is a proposed question whether the language is an instrument for describtion and referensing the existing objects or rather a system that constructs mental representations of a world that helps to circulate in society. </p><div class="quote">Consciousness realizes itself and fills with horror, turns out where language is possible, manifests itself through speech, seeping through itself </div><h3 class="sub"> The grammar of dreams </h3><p>In most cases dreams are the products of subsconsciousness, but there's a category of dreams that are dictated by supraconsciousness. These are hyperreal events that later are perserved in memory. Wherein they are unrelated from human perceptions. What was observed there is totally out of our experience. A dream is populated by two individuals — the dreamer and the dream. The dream is asleep whence the dreamer is awake. So long as the dreamer sleeps he isn't dreaming, but being dreamed. The dreems he contemplates are coming from the rift.  </p><h3 class="sub">Cognitive Map </h3><p>While transitioning into the concept of memory it is necessary to mention the concept of cognitive map [5]. One of the models in formalisation of connections between conscious and matter can be presented in formalising space cells, the ones that are stimulated by condition of being subject on a specific point in space which immediately allows subject to project environment around inside his consciousness (not directly which is discussed in the memory section) which generates the sense of orientation and own presentation in a specific point in space, here and now. In the given framework it's important to metion that for one specific point in space there might be different neurons responsible for its representation due to relativism towards the subject which leads to the concept of population of neurons and therefore its sane to take their colimit. </p><div class="quote">Smart mouse runs the maze and finds the cheese. A really smart mouse fools the scientist and escapes the lab.</div><p>One models of Rosetta biogroupoid [6] of neurons may be considered as a triple $\langle N,N_+,N_* \langle$ where</p><p>$N$  — The category of neurons where morphisms are synaptic paths between them and convolution of paths as their composition</p><p>$N_+$ — The category of topological spaces of neurons $(N,\Gamma)$ and morphisms as continuous maps </p><p>$N_*$ — The category of metric spaces and morphisms are Lipschitz maps for $\lambda = 1$ that preserves distance</p><p>The category of space fields which are responsible for activization arbitrary neurons is presented by constructing noematic representation inside subject's consciousness respectively </p><p>$F_+$ — objects are topological spaces and morphisms are continuous maps </p><p>$F_*$ — objects are metric spaces and morphisms are their contractions </p><p>We can also construct a functor from CAT-Neur into Met which juxtaposes any set of neurons $X$ with its metric correlate $(X,d)$ where $d : X \times X \rightarrow R^+$</p><p>Generalised map of everything is constructed throught patterns and repeated concepts. Subject is tended to emphasise their commonities and classifies them, arranging it within his experience and rearanging it if necessary. Constructs dynamic boxes and fills them with similarities. Neurons accrete with connections, producing new semantic patterns, a cumulus of certain colored rhythm, which strengthens on repetitions. This framework provides a sentimental way of relations with the world throught abyssal patterns-archetypes. This may be instantiated via social relationships, comminication between people where their patterns and emotions are used from experiencing them within previous ones. Their very model of behavior, relation with the outer adjusts to the nearest model of acceptance.  </p><h3 class="sub"> Memory</h3><p>Declarative — time-subjective model of the external with prescribed characteristic of immanent preferences and language development that object operates </p><p>Procedural — unconscious reflexion to the external which is trained from the very birth to the very moment of being (for instance language, body motility, will). </p><p>Episodic memory is a subset of declarative which is responsible for time-subjective prescriptions including modeling of the external present in their subjective representations, situations and facts based on a personal experience inside given context of space-time cone.</p><p>Semantic memory is responsible for subjective-timeless prescriptions such as characterisation of substance which isn't referencing directly on the first instance of their interconnections with substance and its noema (seeng a chair means that the observer prescribes corresponding characteristic while not referensing the first chair he was sitting in his entire life)</p><h3 class="sub">Rift</h3><h3 class="sub"> Spirit</h3><p>The important characteristic of consciousness lies in tradition, beyond rational momentary osmose, the principle of superpermeability and momentary cognition of everything. One example may be provided is intuition, which manifests itself not throught analysis, but throught cognition and identification of itself within the object of perception. For God's Intellect there's no any object for cognition since it's by itself the ultimate Wisdom in all variants of realities. This is a supra-individual sphere that covers the world of forms and concepts. Next step of emanation is formation of indefinite realities with all their sublevels and stratas. The fundamental principle of any manifestation (spiritual beginning Purusha and substance Prakriti) is a separation between spirit and substance which has its degraded boundary only inside Absolute. Hinduism states of trichotomy — Brama, Shiva and Vishnu which is just one aspect of one true God -- Brahman, Absolute, personificated on the religious layer since hinduism has many of them not only the layer of metaphysics.</p><div class="quote">God's Intellect is the first manifestation of Absolute, true beginning of everything without which its creation couldn't be possible.</div><p>As an example, the so-called descent of the Monad into matter means an involution or involving or infolding of spiritual potencies into material vehicles which coincidentally and contemporaneously, through the compelling urge of the infolding energies, unfold their own latent capacities, unwrap them, roll m forth. And this is the evolution of matter. Christ's beginning bestowed Father-shaped form of our body with life, that has risen from the level of organic to soul-spiritual and later — to life of the cognizing consciousness. In the last the gift of the Holy Spirit descens that descended on the apostles on the feast of Pentecost. The spirit descends to bring us into the realm of the highest spiritual Trinity. Synthesis of earthly existence leads to the synthesos of spiritual being. This means that person begins to ascend to eternal being -- the highest Devachan, where emanations of Pralaya carry the phenomenal universe. In the evolution in that state that preceeded eon of ancient Saturn, due to Rudolph Steiner, there was only space. Neutral world fire was fused with space which pured out and limited the thermal substance of ancient Saturn. Because of it there is a misconception of what space may be falsly identified with spirit. The world is random, consciousness is absolute. Existence of experiences is doubtless. It's impossible to doubt the existence of experience if it is already present inside consciousness. Ontology of intentional substances is always doubtful because the very perception might be considered as an illusion. </p><div class="quote">Everything in this world bears witness of the use or misuse of inner talking</div><p>Actual existence of intentional substance doesn't matter for intentional exprience. The illusory ontology of perception doesn't matter from phenomenological point of view since it opposes to not direct transcedental, but as noema which is being perceived in a sense that excludes the question of their existence. From existence of mindstream proceeds that consciousness doesn't depend from existence of transcedental and preserves even after the world's destruction.</p><p>Intentional object is given only with its referenced conscise perception. So, the existence of transcedental that cannot be experienced is denied, all transcedental is available for being experienced and any attempts to penetrate the beyond are as pointless. Even the absolute God-like being cannot perceive objects differently than in phenomena, existence of things in form of phenomenon is characterized by its essence. Connection between intentional perception and its materialistic correlate is not causal one which has its place in present definition of matter. Perceptions are taken not as facts but as essence and therefore the connection is object-essential — its reference is enclosed inside the very essence of perception. The consciousness is inside modus of transcedental reduction -- outside space-time and causality and therefore it's impossible to claim that matter is a reason for perceptions. </p><div class="quote">The existence of nature cannot determine the existence of conscousness because it goes out itself as its correlate. Nature exists only by being constructed in orderly interrelations. </div><p>Intentional object can be perceived as unilateral. Perceptions on the contrary are given in all their completeness. Perceived object is transcedental spatial existence that can appear only within one of its orientation, unilateral, because of its incompleteness and imperfectness. Object cannot be perceived as a whole but only from one of its faces. </p><p>In addition to the current states of consciousness there is also the Proto-Self (pure "Myself"), the one whose gaze penetrates throught any actual cogito, accompanying all experiences it is not itself an experience. Proto-Self is devoid of contents and consequently cannot be described as a whole. Its being is apodictic evidence. </p><div class="quote">Ego is an existence for itself in continuous obviousness and consequently continuously constitutes itself as entity. </div><p>In Cartesian Reflections, Rene describes "Myself" as "not an empty pole of identity", but on the contrary, all acts are deposited in Self in definitions of that make it self-identical. "I am" is "the identical substrate of unchanging perceptions of Myself". In addition, besides Proto-Self, Husserl constitutes the concept of "Ego" within Monad (in Leibniz's sense), which claims that this monad is "Ego in all its certainty". Not as pole and substrate of unchanging perceptions, but their union, which covers  all actual and potential being of the mind, empirical "I am".</p><p>In best case scenario — test messages are reflected with more semantic load which past throught the vicarious context. Because of it, the dialog within an alien context is being complicated and synchronized on a specific rhythm. Perfuctory dialogs is just a simulation of communication. Interlocutors carefully bypass intestine topics by flooding the gaps of information gluttony, dusting the eyes. Others will bypass once you hold your breath. Extramundane and off-system things are being estimated as ridiculousness because of the tendency of maintaining the archaistic model of perception.  Deleuze</p><p>According to the teachings of yoga, there exist 4 planes of human consciousness — Physical, Astral, Mental and Spiritual. They are correspon to 4 states of consciousness -- Ordinary wakefullness, Dreaming, Dreamless sleep and Ecstasy. The goal of yoga is to guide the apprentice to the experience of an ecstatic state of being, to establish contact with supra-personal divine consciousness that his soul vibrates with the hypercosmic Christ. This state of being is called by some authors as the cosmic consciousness.  </p><p>Human's consciousness may be associated with the highest level of cognition that can appear as a result of evolutional development of nature. Due to integral yoga, consciousness is not the final point in the development of being. There are planes of realization even higher (supramental) and lower (submental) than that available for our perception. Since one's mind doesn't have any connection with them and cannot cover the full range of possible conscious states such as vision cannot perceive all range of electromagnetic emission than the next stage of evolution is precisely is to become an aware being on all layers and planes of existence. Realisation of such evolution is the main aim of Sri Aurobindo's yoga.</p><h3 class="sub">Chaos </h3><div class="quote">Probability $\times$ Regulation $=$ Delimination (blind spots of Stasis Field, repellers)</div><p> Emergentism is a philosophical concept meaning that the wholeness which was appeared due the interaction between its functioning parts is something more complicated rather then sum of these parts. This might be instantiated by any behavioral interactions between any species. From chaos-theoretical point of view when one doesn't know the root causes of interaction between parts of any complicated system. From chaos-theoretic point of view the parts of a complicated system which are being interacted within each other due to some unknown root cause are called strange attractors. The very concept of chaos has a fractal structure because of it. Fractal mathematics captures the infinite complexity of nature. The most chaotic nature is exactly in ordered and regulated things because fractal by itself is the purest example of chaos. If one draws 3 fixed points and one point inside the triangle and starts to fill it with other points in a relative distance between the previous point and its verticies, he'll get a Sierpinski triangle from pure chaos. It's a matter of not simple disorder. Chaos explores the transitions between order and disorder, which often occur in surprising ways. This principle is generalized to our world we live in where any measurment is provided only in some degree of accuracy. The system of values, social norms, political forecasts, any forecast at all cannot be provided precisely and have a large influence onto yourself on a long-time period due to butterfly effect. On a short term the player defines the game, on a long one — on the contrary. The set of all these attractors which influence the observer is called Stasis Field. With all the diversity of events and spaces that you can appear in, there're a superset of those places where you cannot (or rather may not, there's no particular reason to do so) (such as empty space inside fractals). Since Stasis Field operates on behavior of macro systems then there might be proposed a hypothetical force which influece on a behavior of quantum systems which is called Genesis Field. If we accept Everett's many world hypothesis, then for any of the world snapshot Stasis Field will be its own while Genesis Field will be universal. Since 1979 in Priston at Princeton University there was PEAR research lab (closed in Feb 2007) that engaged in parapsychological activity in research of psychokinesis and remote viewing. They also researched the ability of consciousness influencing on Genesis Field [4], specifically they used australian quantum RNG number generator to generate a sequence of random numbers while conducting this experiment with a group of volunteers that needed to think of their number therefore believing that this number will be given by generator. This experiment was conducted thousands of times across the world and the results were at least encouraging [6]. </p><p>It's also important to mention Zeno paradox [7] that briefly describes the paradox where quantum entangled particles produce casual relationship on which they influence the past, id est the choice made in future somehow influences the past even though this might seem too paradoxal at first. When the observer expects some specific outcome, the representation of this outcome is partly present in his consciousness in that version of the future, where he observes the given outcome as the result of experiment. These two consequences are influenced by homogenesis, which are attracted to each other in the context of Genesis Field due to distortion of the hyperplane of quantum potentiality. So one can consider that thinking about a specific outcome of events makes it probability of appearing slightly higher. The concept of attractor points on probability simplex attempts to describe the chaotic, yet systemised grouping of generated random values. One can calculate its density by considering the poset of neighborhoods U of attractor point x_a. One can even consider computing homology groups of some neighborhood of infinite dimensional hyperspace to find the most dense repeller points, which are one of those, whose probability in appearing at some of its neighborhood is the lowest. Specifically this means that Genesis Field is somehow predetermines the outcome of such experiment, though Statis Field might also indirectly influence it, though that it might be used for conscise navigation in the plane of potentiality. </p><p>To achieve the pure awarenes, true dharma, the real quiddity, one has to construct his unique image from the given shards of the beyond. From symbols, signs, synchronicities, inside voices and possible misinterpretations. You have to amalgamate your self-manifestation within the elements of firstborn chaos, that lies beyond the possibility of holistic interpretations and consequently make yourself being remanifestated into a different form of being. Then you will trully manifest the cracks inside interlayers of the surrounding reality that itself is extremely unstable and figuratively bursting itself at the seams like is being shocked by high electricity charge. The true metaphysical freedom lies in its variability. All todays institutes instill fear in a person on this ontological ambiguity because once one manifests the interlayers directly, he begins to devour thyself because of inability to make an optimal dicision. Though even Stasis Field contracts this variability to its minimum, establishing the concrete future outcome for everyone and everything at its fundamentality. Throughoud reading this thesis the reader might find itself confused in all those seemingly different presented models and consider that it has no particular well defined aim ane he will be right about this assumption since all communication with sacrecy is based on this ambiguity at the point of maximum distraction. Variability is the key factor of fecundity. The aim of this thesis though might be considered as the variability of the provided result.</p><div class="quote">Intelligence is more than just problem-solving.
