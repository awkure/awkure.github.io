          <div class="article-content">
            <p>Toby − the young boy, who have lived in this world 8 years and 24 days, climed on the tallest tree in the yard, sat down on a fat bought and, chatting with his feet, looked at people walking leisurely around the yard, unhurriedly sitting on benches and leisurely living in principle.</p>

<p>Noisy company of stranger kids jumped out from the nearest entrance, screamed and ran to the playground.</p>

<p>− Stop making noise, buggers! − shouted an elderly woman, who’s name was Claire, who had leaned out of the window on the second floor. She did not know the meaning of the word “buggers”, and therefore, inserted it in place and out of place, giving an emotonal color depending on the context.</p>

<p>The thoughtless Claire’s infatuation in “buggers” was not the only oddity here. 
Every day Toby watched new people in the courtyard. 
The yard remained the same, the house remained the same, the apartments inside the house are also stayed  unchanged.
But the creatures, who lives inside these apartments — on the contrary. 
Men and women, adults and children, cats and dogs every day were new. 
And only Toby with Claire remained in their places.</p>

<p>Nanna Claire was also in the know. 
But she couldn’t remember when it all began. 
At first she did not mentioned this. 
And Toby also simply did not attach any attention to this. 
And then, in the house, there was a gas leak and a terrible explosion.
Many people died.
In the morning the house stood again, like a new one. 
And people inside the house lived are also new.
And only the child and the old woman remained in their places. 
Toby and Claire decided to stick together.</p>

<p>They tried talk to people.
People had known them for a “long time”, and they didn’t notice anything strange.</p>

<p>Once Toby and Claire tried to leave. Leave anywhere.
But in a mile from the house they were met by the armed people, who put them inside a vehicle without numbers and brought them back.</p>

<p>— Perhaps, the god has left us, — said the old woman.</p>

<p>— Or the opposite — found, — answered her Toby.</p>

<p>They tried to do something. They tried to do nothing and have nothing to do. They tried to die. 
They tried to kill. Kill each other. Kill people, cats and dogs. Decisively, nothing changed.
People, cats, dogs every day became new, and only Toby and Claire — are not. And this went for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>Later a man came in a white coat and guard with him. He called Toby and Claire. And he apologized, apologized a lot.
He told that one of the surveyors incorrectly putted marks on the map and exactly this house turned out to be in completely tragic accident, that this house fell into the zone of a psychotropic experiment.</p>

<p>— We’ll fix everything, — said the man in the dressing gown to the little boy with shining eyes, who was on a corpse diet then.</p>

<p>— You have spent here at least 50 years, probably, but did not grow old at all. It’s even a plus! — 
he assured the woman, who every Sunday burned the entire fourth entrance alive, because they always rustled there and after she wrote on their quartered carcasses.</p>

<p>— We will provide you with any help and support, — the man smilled affably, — the car will come for you tomorrow.</p>

<p>But tomorrow a man in a white coat came again and began to say exactly the same thing as yesterday as if he had seen Toby and Claire for the first time.</p>

<p>— Buggers… — Claire whispered and sat down on the ground. 
Toby grabbed the guard and tried to take away his weapons. 
But he got shot in the chest and fell down next to the sitting old lady.</p>

<p>— Tomorrow we’ll try together, — said Claire, looking into the dying eyes of the boy and flopped on her back next to the small body in a puddle of blood.</p>

<p>The sky was clouded.</p>
