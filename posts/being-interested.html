            <h2 id="digression">Digression</h2>
<hr />
<p>After a while being punished by pointing people to their mistakes, I’ve decided to resurrect this blog for a moment. Every time I’m trying to do something valuable to others ends up wiping their feet on me. After all I think that I’m just pointlessly wasting my time even making this post and, consequently, I’ll delete this blog, without any regrets soon.</p>

<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<hr />
<p>We are living in a world of 24/7 CCTV, browser cookies, trackable credit cards, cell phones and GPS, fingerprinting and DNA analysis and despite of that some people still afraid of their privacy. Even today modern society actively using their retina to unlock their phones and <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/06/29/eye-scanning-banks/">make payments</a>. People <em>do</em> care about privacy and the others, who don’t, just resigned themself about the given circumstances. Making the case that information about you, your demographics, your behaviors and habits —all information you may think has little to no value — is valuable to the people looking for it is one important step in explaining why this is all important. After all, if someone a company is able to build their business model on getting your information, it must be worth something. Below described the basics about keeping your identity to yourself.</p>

<p>As thought it sounds corny but at first you need to rethink your appearance. It must be typical and inconspicuous. Clothes count only for first impressions.</p>

<p>Next, you need to study all legislation that may affect you in the future. You need to soberly asses sanctions on articles that you are going to violate. Legal savvy may serve a good service for you in difficult times.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to revise the concept of using mobile phone. This is the most terrible scourge of the modern society. All major developments cannot do without wiretapping and other methods of user analysis. Refusing the mobile can be in favor of “smartphone” with custom rom installed as well as encrypted volume in it and using it only for ther Internet-related things, prefarbly on a separate device without SIM card inserted. If you really need to make calls, then use separate/disposable SIM cards which must be registered to a front.</p>

<h2 id="about-cell-phones">About cell phones</h2>
<hr />
<p>There are some rumors about deanoning your identity through your device:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By determining the source of the radio signal</li>
  <li>By determining with special equipment at the stations of the cellular network</li>
  <li>By determining through various hidden features supposedly specially available in each mobile phone for that kind of purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>In order for investigators to identify the victim who uses fake SIM cards, they use victim’s “real” mobile phone. For an explanatory example it’s worth considering some situations.</p>

<h3 id="you-use-an-anonymous-mobile-phone-but-the-real-one-is-near-and-turned-on">You use an “anonymous” mobile phone, but the real one is near and turned on</h3>
<p>In this case investigators request the logs of the entire mobile cell in which the “anonymous” device is working (or worked). That’s all. This is enough for investigators to find your real device and consequently determine your real identity. And not only by “hot on the trail”, but also in a day/week/month. 
They make recursive sampling all over the switching-on intervals and see who else was in the cell besides the “anonymous” one. For example, inside one cell there were 2000 more phones turned on, next time you turn it on 700 of those that were the first time, next — 35 of those who were in the first and second time and so on. Most often there is a possibility to find from the logs of three or four turnings-on exactly one pair of phones that don’t leave the cell.</p>

<p>In such cases you can try to seek through the history of the numbers of sets of coincidences as well, as their owners. Thus the investigators quickly reach a real phone number, one call history which will reveal all the cards of determining the victim’s identity. Often they may be lucky with 2 turnings-on to quickly learn and sweep out hundreds of numbers to pursue the victim. It’s all about the question of time and the number of employees included. Yes, it even happens that the real number comes from the first turning-on. Dynamics in the cell, the behavior of other devices in weekdays/holidays can greatly simplify the searching.</p>

<p>As practice shows —people can’t multitask as long as the want to, which implies that while you “work” with your “anonymous” device, everyone who calls someone in your cell —come out from suspicion and narrow this ring around you. For example, you are surfing the net “anonymously” and then you had been called to the real phone. You started talking and consequently your traffic on the Internet falls for a time statistically different from the time between average page loads.
Matching all calls in the cell to the exact point in time with the failure of traffic is a matter of seconds. Ofcourse this could be just an accident, but it’s not arduous to check the number twice.</p>

<p>The culprit turned on the device, sent one SMS and then turned it off. A day later, he called to discuss the terms of the deal and turned it off. And later, suppose week after, he reported the venue and the time of the meeting and then turned his phone off. Meanwhile investigators have already analyzed the logs of three “turnings-on” who at the moment was in the cell three times. From the second “reconciliation” left for example 6 numbers, from the third — one.</p>

<h3 id="you-use-an-anonymous-mobile-phone-but-you-are-prudent-and-youre-turning-off-the-real-one-in-advance">You use an anonymous mobile phone, but you are prudent and you’re turning off the real one in advance</h3>
<p>In this case you just simplified the task for the investigators. They look at who turned it off (the phone sends last ACK packet to the network meaning that the phone is turning off) and did not leave the network before the appearance of the “anonymous” one. There will be only a dozen of phones in such cell, or even you only. So, the disconnecting of your phone from the network before using the fake one only worsens anonymity.</p>

<h3 id="you-leave-the-real-phone-at-home-and-go-to-another-cell-to-turn-on-the-anonymous-one">You leave the real phone at home and go to another cell to turn on the “anonymous” one</h3>
<p>Firstly the same scheme is worked out as in the first situation, but not only for one cell, but several —the first one and then the neighboring, and so on until they reach the cell with “anonymous” phone with the cell with your real one. Secondly your device is at home and can’t answer calls. Consequently, sooner or later there will be missed calls which is also visible in the logs. It is only necessary to compare on what device were missed calls and where the anonymous one were “turnined-on”. Almost nobody picking the phone just at the time when you turning off your anonymous device. In addition, this method is very helpful in general search. Investigators can quickly call numbers, which remain after comparing the logs of mobile cells. If the phone does not picking up — put it in the suspects list. Thirdly you can not leave the real phone anywhere every time in different places. Mostly on the same place every time you turning on the anonymous one. In addition it is a good criterion for the filter of how many of the same devices were at the same place in the same cell every time the culprit is turning on the anonymous phone.</p>

<p>What about changing SIM’s? Changing the numbers will still not be a complicate task of finding a real one. If your conversation is simply brazenly was not listened then the investigators will simply analyze not only the one number during these 3 turning-on’s but these 3 turning-on’s on different numbers. Similary, the “dark activity” on the Internet the mobile numbers are frequently combined in a common “case”.[?] Frequent changing of numbers only worsens anonymity, since investigators will receive the groups of numbers and will be able to easily find whence the SIM’s.</p>

<p>Anonymity is not the absence of data for identification. Anonymity is a good imitation of an ordinary, but not the real person.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-benefit-of-getting-your-real-mobile-phone-">What’s the benefit of getting your real mobile phone? [?]</h3>
<p>Everything. Investigators will see whom you’ve called. Surely there are many of them among those who know you personally. They’ll see who and how to replenish the account. Most likely there are payments from a real card through ATM or from a real Webmoney purse etc. That’s it.[?]</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3>
<p>At the workplace of the cell, in which the suspect’s phone is located, an operational group with a special equipment especially with manual directional finder is put forward. In short it’s a simple radioreceiver with an arrow that shows the power of the signal and the antenna, tube and parabolic plate (with several antennas for different working conditions). Information of at what exact frequency works the desired phone is available at the station. Operator tunes the receiver to this frequency, turns around the antenna and looks at the arrow. From where the signal strengthens, he goes there, nothing so difficult. He finds the right floor, then the apartment and that’s it. It all took 25 minutes and your life was ruined one more time. Considering how many of them went to the recommendations like “open by yourself or we will open in any case”, the charges and withdrawal of the suspect. You can estimate how many dozens of homes and thousands of apartments they could have looked into and they found the right one without doing this tedious work.</p>

<h2 id="continuing-the-briefing">Continuing the briefing</h2>
<hr />
<p>It is worth acquiring fake documents like regluing passports or driver ID. These measures will help to hide your personal data, which is need to be protected as the holy grail. For example, investigators watching the car, they don’t know the driver’s name or identity at all and to get to know them without suspicion, they either use camera recordings or attract the traffic police. You may think that it is a normal document check, but in fact you’ve already taken the bait.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/being_interested/camera.jpg" class="fluidbox-trigger">
  <img src="/assets/images/being_interested/camera.jpg" alt="" />
</a></p>

<p>If you had any account in social networks, then it prefarbly should be removed or misinformed, for example by replacing their photos with an outsider. When you are wanted, investigators firstly begin to identify and analyze the person via social networks. And you know exactly what social networks have on you. One IP addres is enough to associate it with your modem even if it’s dynamic and you’ren’t using any VPN sevice about which I’ll speculate later.</p>

<p>Special attention is worth givinng to the technique of movement. If you are driving a car, then the account must be registered on third parties. The best way at the moment is to buy cars with a banned registration activities. They are cheaper and you don’t need to re-register, so you don’t need to pay taxes and fines. During the ride, do provocations like turn sharply and illogically. These actions will help to reveal the outward appearance, if they hang on the tail. It is worth looking in the back mirror more often, rather on the road. Walking is not as comfortable as using a car, but it’s easier to keep your anonymity. It’s easy to operate a taxy or public transport, so it’ll be extremely difficult for investigators to do their job.</p>

<p>When traveling by train or plane you need to know that all the data about your “real identity” remains inside the database. When registering for a flight you must aware about sitting together with someone suspicious or your relatives, so you are for the rest of your life associated with your companions as “connected relatives”. This can’t be done especially if you are flying with accomplices.</p>

<p>Your behavior on the street, communication between your friends and relatives mustn’t in any way reveal your real activity. To do this it’s worthwile to think about a legend, so that it flies from the teeth.</p>

<p>What about computers? They’re pretty hard to use and even harder to keep your anonymity while surfing the Internet. This issue should be approached with special attention. Preparing the machine itself by dismantling a video camera and a microphone from it as well. For this purpose I recommend installing Whonix on an encrypted LVM. It’s necessary to master the basic programs and applications that provide anonymity and work safety on the computer as well as the Linux environment basics itself. In the undefined future I’ll prepare a separate article about the network security basics. Here I’ll mention various programs and names that you need to look at, such as: OpenVPN, any SSH client, Tor bridges, IRC, True crypt, jabber, GPG, OTR and other shits that are easy to google.</p>

<p>Place of residence should not coincide with the place of registration. If you’re pursued it isn’t worth living somewhere in the village with your mother/acquaintance. The district police knows everyone in person there and it is naturally that he will be interested in your personality. Renting a room in the hotel is also the first step of living behind the bars. Housing for rent is the optimal variant, it’s easy to change address and there is a big chance that your landlord won’t complain to the police, because he probably does not pay the taxes about these outgoings (not sure about other countries laws). From the first easy money don’t burden yourself with real estate, this creates additional problems and unwanted attention.</p>

<h2 id="more-about-privacy">More about privacy</h2>
<hr />
<p>Technology, which is designed to give people freedom of speech and opportunity to express their thoughts openly, over the years has become an instrument of control and suppression. Due to the technological improvments of the network, each user is followed by a track from all his activity. Anyone who has the ability to collect this data — gets the opportunity to use it against them. Freedom of speech can’t exist in circumstances where one can punish anyone for their words. Even the possibility itself of being punished raises the wall from censorship and self-censorship, making it impossible for public open discussion. Without these opportunities stagnation begins — that the resource-posessing forces begin to being exploited. Suchwise the function of propaganda is added to the function of supression and control. Due to its open nature, a digital track is available to third parties who can use it to interfere with your personal life.
What should remain in secret may become public property. In such a situation the only effective way to preserve your privacy —is through anonymous behavior, or more precisely, to not allow anyone connect the track from your activity on the Internet with your real personality. To cofront the forces whos will try to take away your freedom of expression below described some methods.</p>

<h3 id="do-not-report-too-much-unnecessary-information">Do not report too much unnecessary information</h3>
<p>There’s a set of attributes — knowing which you can find a specific user from a variety of others. Those include the person’s age, sex, education, place of residence, time zone, profession, hobbies, appearance information and any individual characteristic of this person. Such attributes allow an outsider to effectively filter out unnecessary users on the list, which gradually leads to deanonymization. you can avoid this by developing the habit of just being careful when communicating. In addition you need to learn how to control your emotions and swallow your pride when it’s necessary. In 2010, Bradley Manning in seeking moral support, confessed to his fellow-hacker in a private chat room in the fact that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/how-us-embassy-cables-leaked">he had transferred 250,000 military documents to WikiLeaks</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I would come in with music on a CD-RW labelled with something like ‘Lady Gaga’ … erase the music … then write a compressed split file. No one suspected a thing … [I] listened and lip-synched to Lady Gaga’s Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later this chatlog was published to FBI agents and now Manning is serving a sentence of 35 years. It would not have happend, hold it in his hands.</p>

<h3 id="be-sure-to-change-your-ip-as-well-as-spoofing-your-mac">Be sure to change your IP as well as spoofing your MAC</h3>
<p>It is directly associated with your name in the real world (by contacting with the provider and with dynamic IP − through connection logs). 
The log of connecting a client to the server can be stored on this server almost forever. It’s convient to change your IP through Tor bridge.
Ofcourse IP changing doesn’t only concern surfing web-sites and I think you, as my reader, are well versed in this. Some sites may want to block your IP because of Tor bridges implying malicious activity. It’s also impossible to download torrents through it, since the real IP will “leak” and due its connection speed issues.</p>

<h4 id="why-use-tor-over-anonymous-proxies">Why use Tor over “anonymous” proxies</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The ordinary free web proxies, as a rule, does not encrypt the transmitted data. Therefore they don’t provide any protection if your communication channel is already under your enemy’s surveillance. An elementary analusis of traffic will reveal all the sites you visit as well, as many of the actions that you are doing. Tor always encrypts all transmitted information and even adds some random bytes to it making decrypting even more tedious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many proxies that advertise themself as “anonymous” one are not really that way (they give the destination information about hte user through the HTTP headers). Without special verification, the user can’t be sure that the “anonymous” web proxy is actually is, and that when you visit the website your IP address does not open to the site owners or for MitM attackers. When using Tor your IP address is always hidden.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tor is in the same row with the most accessible methods for anonymization for a beginner user because of its ease of use.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unlike a web proxy, Tor can handle any TCP connection and not just HTTP.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And also it’s recommended to use a trustworthy VPN.</p>

<h3 id="dont-use-the-same-nickname-more-than-once">Don’t use the same nickname more than once</h3>
<p>If you’ll disobey this rule and use the same nickname on a non-anonymous resource, it’ll be easy to connect those resources. Knowing non-anonymous nickname is the stepstone of getting the victim’s real IP. It’s recommended to use online name generators, there are a lot of them.</p>

<h3 id="dont-use-the-same-email-address-while-registering">Don’t use the same email address while registering</h3>
<p>The same goes also to email. Even if it’s not displayed for other users, it’s still available for viewer, or at least to the resource administrator. Use one-time emails or make some by yourself.</p>

<h3 id="always-delete-metadata-while-publishing-anything">Always delete metadata while publishing anything</h3>
<p>Metadata contain records on the basis of which you can completely deanonize the user including: OS, modification time, program were used to modify the file. Modern digital cameras “sewed”[13] <a href="https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/45252/how-to-find-lens-information-from-image-metadata">the model number and the manufacturer of the camera inside photo’s metadata</a>. Some “smartphones” are sewing <a href="https://www.geoimgr.com/">GPS coordinates of the location of the survey inside photos</a>.</p>

<h3 id="improve-the-safety-of-web-surfing">Improve the safety of web surfing</h3>
<p>There are several extensions for popular web-browsers which allow to “remove” known vulnerabilities. <em>NoScript</em> blocks various site scripts that can lead to deanonimization. Some sites won’t work properly after its installation and you may want to add them to the exceptions. The second extension is called <em>HTTPS Everywhere</em>, but it’s already everywhere and there’s no use for it nowdays. Although TLS/SSL certificates are vulnerable and provide a false sense of security and <a href="https://www.ultgate.com/4132/man-in-the-middle-ssl">gives a wonderfull opporunity for MITM attacks</a>. Another possibly usefull extension is <em>RequestPolicy</em> which suppose to protect some data about the user, as well as <em>AdBlock</em> “removes” annoying ads. In settings of the browser itself you need to turn off geolocation scanning, disable Flash and JavaScript for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/11/i-turned-off-javascript-for-a-whole-week-and-it-was-glorious/">obvious reasons</a>.</p>

<h3 id="special-tools-to-store-passwords">Special tools to store passwords</h3>
<p>Sometimes it’s tedious to remember every unique 64 characters long alphanumeric password so it needs to be stored somewhere. Utilities like gnu pass stores each password inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title of website or resource that requires the password. You may use it or write the password on a piece of paper and store it somewhere deep inside your heart or scratch it on a window, I don’t fucking care.</p>

<h3 id="the-otr-encryption">The OTR encryption</h3>
<p>More and more, governments and corporations are trying to read your personnel communications. From the illegal wiretaps by NSA to Sweden’s and Russian’s new law requiring all network traffic originating to or from be archived, no one is safe. A recent study even showed that one out of every three system administrators viewed rosurces, including your private data, to which they were not allowed access. Being these individuals have access to the network, its encryption can’t be the only answer (MitM attacks for example). Given the NSA and vaious telecom providers warantless wiretapping activities, your IM traffic, in fact all of your traffic is becoming available to prying eyes. Even using SSL encryption for public IM services are not helpful as a subpoena forces them to turn over the logs of the conversation which they store on their server. This is where Off-The-Record encryption needs to be used. It’s an end-to-end encryption scheme that automatically creates one-time session keys (pads) and encrypts all messages. OTR has a various authentification features like exchanging them through the identifiers of permanent keys through another means of communication such as phone, or through a common secret, which must be agreed in advance. OTR plugins are available for most messengers and work well on XMPP, IRC and other protocols.</p>

<h3 id="dont-use-proprietary-software-for-very-obvious-reasons">Don’t use proprietary software for very obvious reasons</h3>

<h3 id="learn-linux">Learn Linux</h3>
<p>Some “advanced” users can improve security of their system even more. But those tools and methods, needed for this purpose mostly depends on specific tasks. In some cases <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page">Whonix</a> may be useful. This distribution allows you to create isolated virtual machines, the internet traffic of which is fully proxified through Tor bridges. Whonix mitigates the thread of common attack vectors while maintaining usability and it requires a fairly powerful hardware to run isolated virtual machines. Gentoo users may want to check out
<a href="https://grsecurity.net/features.php">GrSecurity</a>, which is basically enchancement and patches to the Linux kernel, this distribution’s named <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo">Hardened Gentoo</a>. There’s also SELinux − a secutiry module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NSA Security-enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel and some utilities to incorporate a strong, flexible mandatory access control (MAC) architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. It provides an enhanced mechanism to enforce the separation of information based on confidentiality and integrity requirements, which allows threats of tampering and bypassing of application security mechanisms to be addressed and enables the confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed applications. It includes a set of sample security policy configuration files designed to meet common, general-purpose security goals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There probably will be a separate article about linux security.</p>

<h3 id="always-check-the-checksums-of-downloaded-files">Always check the checksums of downloaded files</h3>
<p>This will help to ensure the integrity of downloaded software. In case if files were corrupted during the download or intentionally changed by an attacker even by one byte, the checksum of this file will be completely different. This’s achieved due to the avalanche effect of hash functions. In addition to checksums, some developers use GPG signatures. Usually they sign their release with these keys, acting as a guarantor of reliability. For example Tor sources for many years was signed by Erinn Clark. Checking the signatures of downloaded software is a good practice, since it helps to establish the reliability and integrity of the important programs.</p>

<h3 id="disk-encryption">Disk encryption</h3>
<p>Tools like <em>dm-crypt</em> and <em>TrueCrypt</em> protect the computer from physicall access by encrypting the disk and decrypting it while the system boots. Linux users have a builtin dm-crypt, which has all necessary utilities for disk encryption. Bear in mind that you’ll need to encrypt your SWAP as well otherwise some data will not be protected. It’s also necessary to configure your DE for instant shutdown of the machine, since only shutdown helps securely lock up data in an emergency situation. Useful in some cases the encryption with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability">plausible deniability</a>” means the ability to deny the presence of certain information on your hard disks or some other data and it must be unprovable on the contrary to your statemets.
In practice this means unprovable presence of all or part of your encrypted volumes. Providing plausible deniability is one of the most valuable features of modern disk encryption tools. Some retrogrades and Windows users may use TrueCrypt which ceased to exist in May 2014 under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#End_of_life_announcement">mysterious circumstances</a>. The only reliable source to download TrueCrypt is the <a href="http://cyberside.net.ee/truecrypt/">repository with all its signatures</a>. For those who need an alternative to TrueCrypt there’s <a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/">VeraCrypt</a>. This project inheirts parts of the TrueCrypt code, has a compatibility with TrueCrypt’s volumes and being actively developed. 
Another TrueCrypt successor is <a href="https://ciphershed.org/about">Ciphershed</a>. However it’s still in early stage of development. Using disk encryption you must be warned of the possibility of several dangers. One of them is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot attack</a> which allows you to start the machine in a short period after shutdown. The second one is <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.se/2009/10/evil-maid-goes-after-truecrypt.html.">Evil Maid</a> attacks, which allow attacker steal a password from an encrypted partition. All this must be taken into account while leaving computer unattended.</p>

<p>Instead of using your built-in WiFi card you should using an external one connected via USB. This gives you an opportunity to completely and reliably disconnect the computer from the network if necessary. You should beware of the built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">IAM</a>(Identity and Access Management). This system provieds the manufacturer with remote full acces to the machine. Initially this system was used to track to track the target’s trace in case of stealing, but it can be used for anything. The concept depicted on the picture above.</p>

<p>Don’t buy computers delivered by mail. The NSA has a unit called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations">Tailored Access Operations</a> whose job is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations">intercept mail parcels with computers, installing some hardware and software marks</a> and then send it to the recepient. According to the raport, this scheme is considered one of the most effective for getting access to the desired system.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<hr />
<p>There is not clear boundaries between “anonymous/non-anonymous” state. This state directly depends on the threat model, different attackers have different resources for their activity. To be fully protected from NSA, requires the most outstanding techniques. Not having enough data about the model of threats − then the choice of the tools used should be made on the basis of compromise. On one hand lies the usual convenience, on the other there’s huge risk of disclosing sensitive data generated by user. It should also be borne in mind that 90% of the data obtained by investigators originate from open sources. Living in digital age, ordinary users by their own ignorance make up their dossier. Posessing personal data gives power, so owning it will always provide interest from the outside. Anonymity is difficult, information security is even more difficult. No one will protect your data and no one will keep your privacy, except yourself.</p>

<p>Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.</p>
